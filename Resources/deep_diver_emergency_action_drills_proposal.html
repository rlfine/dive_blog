<h2>Deep Diver Emergency Action Drills Proposal</h2>
<p>Supplement to Standard NAUI Deep Diver Curriculum</p>
<p>Goal: Enhance diver emergency awareness, control, and safe execution of failure responses at depths of 80–100 ft.</p>
<h2>Core Drills</h2>
<ol>

<li>Buoyancy Compensator (BC) Failure Simulation</li>
<topic_item>Scenario: </topic_item>Simulated BC inflator rupture or complete BC failure at depth.
<br><topic_item>Drill:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Diver establishes neutral buoyancy using breathing control and/or ditchable weights (if practical).</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Practice controlled ascent without BC inflation, using breathing techniques and oral inflation only once shallow.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item>Objective:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Demonstrate composure and ascent control without relying on BC.</topic_sub_item>

<li>First Stage Regulator Failure Simulation</li>
<topic_item>Scenario A:</topic_item> First Stage Free-Flow (constant bubble stream).
<br><topic_item>Scenario B:</topic_item> First Stage Failure (no air delivery).
<br><topic_item>Drill:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - In free-flow: Switch to alternate air source (octo) or redundant gas source if equipped (pony, bailout).</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - In shutdown/no-air: Immediate gas-sharing protocol with buddy, ascend together under control.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item>Objective:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - React calmly to catastrophic gas delivery failures.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Practice gas-switching, shutdown (if using DIN/Yoke isolator valves), and emergency ascent.</topic_sub_item>

<li>Out-of-Air Situations at Depth</li>
<topic_item>Scenario:</topic_item> Complete simulated out-of-air at 100 ft.
<br><topic_item>Drill:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Signal "out of air" to buddy.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Execute controlled gas sharing ascent using buddy’s alternate air source.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item>Objective:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Practice buddy awareness, rapid communication, and gas sharing ascent while managing buoyancy.</topic_sub_item>

<li>Primary Mask Flood/Removal at Depth</li>
<topic_item>Scenario:</topic_item> Mask completely dislodged at 100 ft.
<br><topic_item>Drill:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Full mask removal, replacement, and clearing at depth.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item>Objective:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Maintain composure without visual reference.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Avoid rapid ascent or panic response.</topic_sub_item>

<li>Controlled Emergency Swimming Ascent (CESA) from Moderate Depth</li>
<topic_item>Scenario:</topic_item> Simulate total air loss at ~30–40 ft.
<br><topic_item>Drill:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Controlled ascent to surface on one breath, slowly exhaling bubbles.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item> Note:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Only recommended from ~30–40 ft for safety, not from full depth.</topic_sub_item> 
<br><topic_item>Objective:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item>- Build confidence in CESA technique, timing, and lung volume management.</topic_sub_item>

<li>Redundant Gas Source Deployment (Optional)</li>
<topic_item>Scenario:</topic_item> Diver practices switching to independent gas source at depth.
<br><topic_item>Drill:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Deploy pony bottle second stage.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Secure normal ascent using own gas without buddy assistance.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item>Objective:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Self-reliant response to catastrophic primary system failure.</topic_sub_item>
</ol>

<h2>Safety Controls for All Drills</h2>
<topic_item>Pre-briefing:</topic_item> 
<br><topic_sub_item> - Thorough planning and contingency discussions before each drill.</topic_sub_item> - 
<br><topic_item>Abort Criteria:</topic_item> 
<br><topic_sub_item> - Immediate abort if diver shows distress, loses control, or upon instructor signal.</topic_sub_item> - 
<br><topic_item>Equipment:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Redundant air supply strongly recommended for regulator failure drills at depth.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - SMB (Surface Marker Buoy) deployment on ascent if surfacing away from boat/shore.</topic_sub_item>
<br><topic_item>Buddy System:</topic_item>
<br><topic_sub_item> - Buddy and instructor within arm’s reach for all critical failure drills.</topic_sub_item> 

<h2>Summary</h2>
These exercises are intended to supplement standard Deep Diver training, emphasizing problem-solving, composure, and emergency ascent techniques at recreational deep depths (to 130 ft max).
