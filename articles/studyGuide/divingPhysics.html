      <h1>Foundational Scuba Diving Knowledge</h1>
      <p>
        We live at the bottom of an ocean of air. We are adapted to these surroundings. Our bodies, our senses, our
        perceptions, our instincts have evolved in response to our terrestrial environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many properties of the aquatic environment that can have profound, even life threatening effects if we
        do not understand and compensate for them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many persons see physics as a challenging if not a daunting subject. They are not comfortable with numbers and
        mathematics. Remember, the numbers and the formulas encountered along the way are simply tools, not ends in
        themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        The early scientific discoverers used mathematics to better understand and describe what they were
        actually observing. We, as divers that are purposely expanding our knowledge and skills, can benefit
        from the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Dive Physics course of study in the NAUI Master Scuba Diver is intended to extendsour knowledge by further
        defining concepts and providing the diver with tools for solving diving-related problems. The goal is to provide
        a better and deeper understanding of the principles of physics as they affect each of us in our diving.

        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: About 77.4 cubic feet (≈ 2190 liters).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q77: What does gas density affect in diving?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: Breathing resistance and work of breathing — denser gases increase effort, especially at depth.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q78: How is gas absorption affected by depth?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: The greater the depth, the higher the partial pressures, and the faster gases are absorbed into tissues.

        <button class="accordion">Q79: What does the abbreviation ATA mean?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: Atmospheres Absolute — includes atmospheric pressure plus pressure from water depth.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Q80: What happens if ascent is too fast?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: Inert gases can come out of solution too quickly, forming bubbles and leading to decompression sickness
            (DCS).</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q81: What causes the pressure of a gas in a container?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: Gas pressure in a container is caused by the constant collisions of gas molecules against the container
            walls; more more molecules in constant volume means more collisions, more collisions mean higher pressure.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q82: What is a vacuum?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: A vacuum is a space entirely devoid of matter, especially air or gas molecules — it has no pressure, or
            as close to zero pressure as physically possible.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q83: If a vacuum is the absence of pressure, can pressure go negative — <br> is there
          something beyond a vacuum?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: No, pressure cannot go negative. A perfect vacuum represents zero absolute pressure. There's no such
            thing as "less than no molecules" or negative pressure in physical reality.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Q84: How much additional weight is needed for neutral buoyancy in salt water vs fresh
          water?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If a diver is neutrally buoyant with 8 lbs of lead in fresh water, they typically need 2–4 additional
            pounds in salt water due to the increased density. For most divers, this means 10–12 lbs total. The exact
            amount depends on factors such as wetsuit thickness, tank type, and personal buoyancy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q85: How can a diver estimate the required lift capacity of a lift bag to recover an
          object?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Determine the object's weight in water by subtracting displaced water weight from dry weight. Since each
            liter of displacement provides ~2.2 lbs of lift, a 100 lb object displacing 30 liters would weigh 34 lbs
            underwater, requiring a lift bag rated for at least 40–45 lbs with margin.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q086: What is tidal volume?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: Tidal Volume (TV) is the amount of air you breathe in or out during a normal, relaxed breath. In a
            healthy adult at rest, this is typically about 500–700 mL (0.5–0.7 liters) per breath. It plays a key role
            in estimating respiratory minute volume (RMV), which is important for gas planning in diving. RMV is
            calculated as Tidal Volume × Breathing Rate, and is used to understand how much gas a diver will consume per
            minute at the surface.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q87: What is a typical tidal volume during average-speed walking?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: During moderate activity like average-speed walking (~3–4 mph), a healthy adult’s tidal volume typically
            increases to around 1.0 to 1.5 liters per breath. This is a natural response to the body's higher oxygen
            demand and increased carbon dioxide production. Alongside a breathing rate of 20–30 breaths per minute, this
            results in a Respiratory Minute Volume (RMV) of approximately 20–45 liters per minute — a substantial
            increase from resting values.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q88: What is the average tidal volume for an adult male slowly finning at 90 ft in
          saltwater?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A: At 90 feet (27 meters) in saltwater, the ambient pressure is 4 ATA (1 atm atmospheric + 3 atm water).
          </p>
          <p>A diver’s lungs still inhale the same physical volume per breath (e.g., 0.6–0.9 L), but the gas is 4×
            denser, so each breath contains 4× the number of molecules compared to the surface.
          </p>
          <p> That means each breath uses 2.4–3.6 L of surface-equivalent air. With a moderate breathing rate of 15–20
            breaths per minute, the diver may consume 36–72 L of surface air per minute.
          </p>
          <p>This highlights why deeper dives require careful gas planning and why understanding tidal volume is
            essential in dive physiology.

            The coolest water temperature most divers can be <strong>reasonably comfortable in with no thermal

          <p><strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Individual physiology matters. Lean divers, older adults, or those with low
            activity levels chill faster. Cold water draws heat from your body ~25x faster than air.</p>

          <p><strong>💡 Rule of thumb:</strong> If you would be shivering after floating in it for 20 minutes, you
            probably need at least a thin wetsuit.</p>
