      <h1>Foundational Scuba Diving Knowledge</h1>
      <p>As divers transition from rental equipment to their own gear, a solid foundation in dive physics, physiology,
        and marine awareness ensures informed decisions and safer dives.</p>

      <div class="accordion-container">

        <button class="accordion">Q1: How much additional weight is needed for neutral buoyancy in salt water vs fresh
          water?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If a diver is neutrally buoyant with 8 lbs of lead in fresh water, they typically need 2–4 additional
            pounds in salt water due to the increased density. For most divers, this means 10–12 lbs total. The exact
            amount depends on factors such as wetsuit thickness, tank type, and personal buoyancy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q2: What's the difference between venomous and poisonous marine life?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><strong>Venomous</strong> creatures inject toxins via sting, bite, or puncture—like lionfish and cone
            snails. <strong>Poisonous</strong> animals are harmful if touched or ingested—like certain pufferfish
            organs. This distinction affects emergency responses and safety precautions.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q3: How can a diver estimate the required lift capacity of a lift bag to recover an
          object?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Determine the object's weight in water by subtracting displaced water weight from dry weight. Since each
            liter of displacement provides ~2.2 lbs of lift, a 100 lb object displacing 30 liters would weigh 34 lbs
            underwater, requiring a lift bag rated for at least 40–45 lbs with margin.</p>
