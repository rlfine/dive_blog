        Final Comprehensive Master Scuba Diver Examination
        <br>Sample Test<br> <span style="color:blue;font-size:16px">(not NAUI official or even sanctioned)</span>
      </h2>


      <p>The NAUI (National Association of Underwater Instructors) Comprehensive Final Exam is a critical component of
        the NAUI Open Water Scuba Diver certification process. It assesses your understanding of essential scuba diving
        principles to ensure you're prepared for safe and responsible diving
      </p>

      <h3>
        The exam evaluates your knowledge across several key areas:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Scuba Equipment: Proper use and maintenance of gear.</li>
        <li>Dive Physics: Understanding gas laws and pressure-related concepts.</li>
        <li>Physiology: Effects of diving on the human body.</li>
        <li>Dive Planning: Using dive tables and computers for safe dive profiles.</li>
        <li>Safety Procedures: Emergency protocols and risk management.</li>
        <li>Environmental Awareness: Protecting marine ecosystems.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>
        The objective of the comprehensive assessment is to ensure you have a grasp of the theoretical knowledge and are
        ready to apply that knowledge to real-world diving situations.

        <button class="accordion">Q121: Bonus: Why don't dangerous bubbles form when descending to depth?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>When a diver descends, ambient pressure increases — from 1 ATA at the surface to over 5 ATA at 130 feet.
            This pressure increase causes nitrogen to dissolve into body tissues, not come out of solution. There is no
            supersaturation, so there’s no drive for bubble formation.</p>
          <p>In fact, any microscopic gas nuclei that do exist (from previous dives or normal physiology) are compressed
            by the increasing pressure, becoming smaller and more stable. Bubble formation requires a decrease in
            pressure, not an increase — which is why the ascent is the critical phase, not the descent.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q122: Bonus: If bubbles were present during descent, why don't they damage
          tissue?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Even if small bubbles or gas nuclei were somehow present during descent, they would not pose a risk.
            Boyle’s Law tells us that increasing pressure compresses gas volumes. At 130 feet, a bubble would shrink to
            roughly 1/5 of its surface size. This compression dramatically increases the surface tension and pressure
            inside the bubble, often causing it to dissolve back into surrounding tissue.</p>
          <p>Since tissue damage (such as tearing or inflammation) occurs from bubble expansion, not compression, there
            is no mechanical disruption or injury from these stabilized or shrinking bubbles. That’s why descent is not
            dangerous in this respect — it's the ascent, especially if rapid or poorly managed, that causes bubbles to
            grow and exert physical force on surrounding tissue.</p>

          O<sub>2</sub> to
          add to then top off with air to get the EAN36 mixture?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A diver has a <strong>steel HP100 tank</strong> with <strong>1800 psi of
              EAN32</strong> remaining and wants to top it off to <strong>3400 psi of EAN36</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Approach:</strong>To get to the target pressure of 3400 psi, starting with 1800 psi, diver needs to
            add 1600 psi of something (e.g., pure O₂ and then air).
          </p>

          <p>To determine how much pure O₂ (100%) to add to the HP100 steel tank, then top off with air to reach EAN36,
            we use <strong>partial pressure blending</strong>.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Step 1 – Calculate target O₂ pressure:</strong>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">Final desired mix = 36% O₂</span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">Final pressure = 3400 psi</span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:26px;"> ⇒ <code>0.36 × 3400 = 1224 psi O₂</code></span>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Step 2 – Calculate current O₂ pressure:</strong>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">Existing mix = 32% O₂ at 1800 psi</span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:26px;">⇒ <code>0.32 × 1800 = 576 psi O₂</code></span>
          </p>

          <p style="margin-left:16px;">For 3400 psi final state, diver needs to add 648 psi of O₂ to the tank.
            <br>Some of the O₂ comes from pure O₂, some from air. <br>
            Let's compute the amount needed from pure O₂ needes.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Step 3 – Set up blending equation:</strong>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">If we let <code style="font-weight: bold;">X</code> = psi of pure O₂ to
              add, then 0.21 × (1600 - <span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span>) will be the amount of O₂ in psi to be
              added from air.</span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">Remaining top-off will be with air (21% O₂)</span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:26px;">
              <code>576 + <span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> + 0.21 × (1600 -  <span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span>) = 1224</code></span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:26px;">
              <code>576 + <span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> - 0.21<span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> + 0.21 × 1600 = 1224</code></span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:26px;">
              <code>576 +  0.79<span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> + 0.21 × 1600 = 1224</code></span>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Step 4 – Solve:</strong>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;"> <code>912 + 0.79<span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> = 1224</code></span>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">
              <code><span style="font-weight: bold;">X</span> ≈ 395 psi of pure O₂</code></span>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
            <br><span style="margin-left:12px;"> Add <strong>395 psi of pure O<sub>2</sub></strong>, then top off with
              1205 psi of air to 3400 psi. </span>
              <br><span style="margin-left:12px;">The resulting mix will be <strong>EAN36</strong></span>.
