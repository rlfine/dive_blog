      <p>As divers transition from rental equipment to their own gear, a solid foundation in dive physics, physiology,
        and marine awareness ensures informed decisions and safer dives.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Q1: How much additional weight is needed for neutral buoyancy in salt water vs fresh
          water?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If a diver is neutrally buoyant with 8 lbs of lead in fresh water, they typically need 2–4 additional
            pounds in salt water due to the increased density. For most divers, this means 10–12 lbs total. The exact
            amount depends on factors such as wetsuit thickness, tank type, and personal buoyancy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q2: What's the difference between venomous and poisonous marine life?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><strong>Venomous</strong> creatures inject toxins via sting, bite, or puncture—like lionfish and cone
            snails. <strong>Poisonous</strong> animals are harmful if touched or ingested—like certain pufferfish
            organs. This distinction affects emergency responses and safety precautions.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q3: How can a diver estimate the required lift capacity of a lift bag to recover an
          object at depth in saltwater?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The first step is to determine the object's volume and dry weight. To determine the objects weight in
            water, subtract the weight of the displaced water (e.g., the buoyant force) from the object's dry weight.
          </p>
          <p> Since each liter of displacement of saltwater provides ~2.3 lbs of lift, and that lift or buoyancy
            counters the objects dry weight, we subtract the weight of the displaced water from the dry weight of the
            object, to find the required lifting force.
          </p>
          <p> For our example, we assume the object has a dry weight of 100 lbs and a volume of 0.44 ft<sup>3</sup>.
          <ul>
            <li>Dry weight of object at surface: <strong>45.4 kg (100 lbs)</strong></li>
            <li>Water displacement of object (volume): <strong>12.4 liters (0.44 ft<sup>3</sup>)</strong></li>
            <li>Weight of 1 liter saltwater <strong>1.03 kg (2.3 lb)</sup></strong></li>
            <li>Weight of 12 liters saltwater: <strong>12.7 kg (~28 lb)</sup></strong></li>
            <li>Lift required for object in saltwater: <strong>45.4 kg - 12.7 kg = 32.7 KG (100 lb - 28.2 lb = 71.8
                lb)</sup></strong></li>
          </ul>
