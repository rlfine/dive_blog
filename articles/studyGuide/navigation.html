      <p>
        To navigate means to control a course of travel through the use of calculations regarding position and
        direction. To a diver, it means controlling a course while diving so you know where you are at all times in
        relation to a given point, such as an exit area.
      <p>
      <p>
        Navigation has many applications for divers. The skill can be used to locate or to relocate a dive site, to
        conduct a dive pattern, to search for lost objects, and to conduct environmental surveys. All divers have the
        need for a variety of navigational skills simply because even the best underwater visibility is insufficient to
        permit navigation by vision alone.

        <!-- beginning of first of many Q&A items -->
        <button class="accordion">Q1: What are the main parts of the diver's compass, and what is the function of
          each?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/compassIdentified.png" alt="compass part identification"
              style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;width: 72%;">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Luminescent Dial:</strong> The rotating needle or card that always points north. It's coated
              with glow-in-the-dark material so it remains visible in low-light or murky conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Lubber Line:</strong> A fixed line inside the compass housing that represents the direction the
              diver is facing. Used to align with a bearing during navigation.</li>
            <li><strong>Rotating Bezel:</strong> A moveable ring with degree markings. Divers align it with the north
              indicator on the dial to maintain a specific heading or calculate return bearings.</li>
            <li><strong>Index Marks:</strong> Markers (often double lines or arrows) on the bezel that are aligned with
              the lubber line. These help the diver keep track of the intended direction or heading over time.</li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>


        <!-- Same CSS and JavaScript from previous snippet assumed already present -->

        <button class="accordion">Q2 What is compass deviation, and what causes it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Compass deviation is the error caused by local magnetic fields within the diver’s gear or equipment, such
            as a metal tank or dive light. It causes the compass needle to deflect from magnetic north. Deviation varies
            by orientation and should be minimized by keeping metal and electronics away from the compass.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q3 What is compass declination, and what causes it?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Compass declination is the difference between magnetic north and true north. It varies by geographic
            location due to the Earth's magnetic field not aligning with its geographic poles. Local charts provide
            declination values to adjust compass bearings for accurate navigation.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q4 In compass navigation, what are range and fix?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A range is a line of position determined by aligning two landmarks. A fix is a precise position established
            by the intersection of two or more such ranges or bearings. Together, they help divers locate their exact
            position underwater.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q5 In scuba navigation, what is pilotage?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Pilotage involves navigating by visual references, such as reef structures, sand channels, or distinctive
            rocks. Divers use these natural markers as visual cues to determine their location and direction.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q6 In scuba navigation, what is dead reckoning?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Dead reckoning is the process of estimating a position based on direction, speed, and elapsed time without
            using external references. Divers use this when visibility is poor or landmarks are not available.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q7 What are the steps for using a compass to dive a precise pattern, such as a
          square pattern?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>1. Choose a starting heading (e.g., 0°).<br>
            2. Swim a fixed distance or time while maintaining that heading.<br>
            3. Turn 90° to a new heading (e.g., 90°) and swim the same distance.<br>
            4. Repeat two more times, each time turning 90°, to complete the square.<br>
            5. Monitor kick cycles and time closely to maintain consistent legs.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q8 What is a reciprocal course?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A reciprocal course is 180° opposite your current heading. For example, the reciprocal of 78° is 258°. This
            course helps you return along the same path you came from.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q9 When swimming an underwater search pattern, what is leeway, and how does a diver
          compensate?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Leeway is the sideways drift caused by currents or surge. To compensate, divers can adjust their heading
            slightly into the current or use visual markers to realign after each search leg.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q10 When swimming an underwater search pattern, how can a diver circumnavigate an
          obstacle?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If a diver encounters an obstacle, they should maintain compass awareness, note their current heading, swim
            around the object, and then return to the same bearing and distance to continue the pattern uninterrupted.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q11 What three pieces of equipment are essential for recreational diving?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The three essential navigation tools are: a compass, a dive watch or timer, and a depth gauge (or dive
            computer). Together, they help monitor heading, duration, and depth for safe and effective navigation.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q12 What are the two basic uses of a compass?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>1. Maintaining a heading during navigation.<br>
            2. Determining return bearings to a known location, such as the entry point or anchor line.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q13 How can the dive watch be used in navigation?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A dive watch helps track elapsed time, which is essential for estimating distance traveled during kick
            cycles. When combined with a known heading and speed, it supports dead reckoning.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q14 What is a kick cycle?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A kick cycle is a unit of distance based on a diver’s consistent number of kicks. For example, 20 kicks may
            equal 10 meters. Divers use this for estimating distance during navigation.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q15 List five natural navigational aids of potential use to divers.</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>1. Bottom topography (sand ripples, ridges)<br>
            2. Light patterns or shadows<br>
            3. Water surge direction<br>
            4. Fish schools or coral types<br>
            5. Temperature gradients or thermoclines</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q16 What is the difference between compass declination (variation) and
          deviation?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Declination is the geographic offset between magnetic and true north and varies by location. Deviation is a
            compass error caused by nearby magnetic sources. Declination is external, deviation is local.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q17 What is the reciprocal course of 78 degrees?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The reciprocal course of 78° is 258°. (78 + 180 = 258)</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q18 A drifting object travels 23 meters (75 feet) on the surface in 30 seconds. What
          is the current speed in knots?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Current speed = (75 ft / 30 sec) = 2.5 ft/sec.<br>
            Convert to knots: 2.5 ft/sec × 0.592484 = <strong>~1.48 knots</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q19 – A diver needs to swim 700 yards on heading 135°, but there is a 4-knot cross
          current. How does the diver determine the correct course to swim and for how long?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>To swim a straight course in the presence of a cross current, a diver must adjust their heading slightly
            into the current. This is known as <strong>crabbing into the current</strong>. The problem is a classic
            vector triangle: one vector is the diver’s swimming speed, another is the current speed, and the resultant
            is the desired heading (135° in this case).
          </p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>


          <p>
            Water motion, especially current, tends to push you off course unless you’re swimming directly into or away
            from it.
            In many instances, you’ll need to adjust for it as you navigate.
            If it’s weak, sometimes you can overcome its effects just by swimming slightly into it as you travel,
            but for stronger currents, you’ll have to adjust for it.
            One approach is to determine a compensated start point, and then swim the original heading.
          </p>
          <h4>Here is an approach:</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Determine the estimated time to your destination by dividing your swimming
              speed into the distance to your destination.</li>
            <li>Face your intended travel direction, establish neutral buoyancy and then hover. Let the current
              carry you downstream for five seconds. If the start point has obstructions in the area that you
              would hit doing this, or that block the current, move to a clear area to do this.
            </li>
            <li>After five seconds, turn into the current and swim back to where you started drifting, counting kick
              cycles.
            </li>
            <li>Multiply the number of kick cycles times the swim time. To find your compensated start point,
              drop the last digit and multiply by two. Swim directly up current that number of kick cycles from your
              original start point.
            </li>
            <li>Turn to your desired heading and begin your swim. Don’t stop, and don’t fight the current or your
              navigation will be off.
              Again, the exact current angle doesn’t matter.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3> Example</h3>

          <p style="margin-left:18px;"><strong> Metric</strong><br>
            Suppose you swim 1.5 metres per second and you are 90 metres from your destination.
            It will therefore take you 60 seconds to swim there (90 metres ÷ 1.5 metres/second = 60 seconds.)
          </p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18px;"><strong> Imperial</strong><br>
            Suppose you swim 5 feet per second and you are 300 feet from your destination.
            It will therefore take you 60 seconds to swim there (300 feet ÷ 5 feet/second = 60 seconds).
          </p>
          <p>
          After drifting with the current five seconds, it takes you four kick cycles to return to the start point.
          <br><br>
          <strong>Calculate: </strong>
          <br><span style="margin-left:18px;">4 kick cycles x 60 seconds = 240. </span>
          <br><span style="margin-left:18px;">Drop the “0” &#x2192 24.&nbsp; 24 x 2 = 48.</span>
          <br><span style="margin-left:18px;">Swim directly up current 48 kick cycles to start your run.</span>
          </p>

        </div>




        <button class="accordion">Q20 How does a diver calibrate distance using kick cycles?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>To calibrate distance using kick cycles, a diver measures how far they travel over a known distance—such as
            a 100-foot rope or pool lane—while counting each full kick cycle. Divide the known distance by the number of
            kicks to determine average distance per cycle. This allows accurate distance estimates during underwater
            navigation by counting kicks.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a diver swims 100 feet in 25 kick cycles. That means each cycle covers 4
            feet. To swim 180 feet, the diver would need:<br>
            180 ÷ 4 = <strong>45 kick cycles</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q21 How does a diver calibrate distance using a timer or a stopwatch?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>To calibrate distance with a timer, the diver swims a known distance at a relaxed, consistent pace while
            timing the swim. By dividing distance by time, the diver calculates average swim speed (e.g., feet per
            second). This speed can then be used to estimate distances during a dive by tracking elapsed time underwater
            while maintaining a consistent pace.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose a diver swims 100 feet in 60 seconds. That equals 100 ÷ 60 = 1.67 feet
            per second. To swim 180 feet, the diver would need:<br>
            180 ÷ 1.67 ≈ <strong>108 seconds</strong>, or about <strong>1 minute and 48 seconds</strong>.
