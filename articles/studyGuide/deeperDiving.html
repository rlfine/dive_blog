      <h1>Foundational Scuba Diving Knowledge</h1>
      <p><strong>Deep Diving</strong> as defined by NAUI is any dive that occurs between 18m and 40m (60ft and 130ft).
        Dives beyond 40m (130ft) are beyond the scope and training fopr recreational divers.
        Deep dives also differ from shallower dives with respect to temperature changes, breathing resistance, reduced
        light, possible narcosis, additional buoyancy adjustments, and anxiety. A precautionary stop is particularly
        important at the end of any deep dive; this refers to a non-required decompression stop made as a safety
        precaution. All but the shallowest dives should incorporate such a stop.
      </p>

      <div class="accordion-container">

        <button class="accordion">Q1: What is the NAUI guiding principle that is used to determine the minimum weight to
          use, especially for a deep dive??
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Your guiding principle should be to use the minimum amount of weight which will provide neutral buoyancy at
            5 meters (15 feet) of depth with an empty buoyancy compensator and a nearly-empty cylinder.
            This ensures the ability to execute a precautionary safety stop at 5 meters (15 feet) at the end of a dive
            without risking premature surfacing.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q2: NAUI recommends diver attach nothing to their ballast system that is also attached
          to something else. What is the rationale for this recommendation?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Attach nothing to your ballast system that is also attached to something else. This could prevent
            jettisoning your weights in an emergency.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q3: At a depth of 130 feet (40 meters), what is the absolute pressure in ATA?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Absolute pressure = (depth in feet / 33) + 1.<br>
            130 ÷ 33 = ~3.94 + 1 = ~4.94 ATA..</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q4: What is Boyle’s Law and how does it relate to deep diving?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Boyle’s Law states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure on it (at constant
            temperature). <br>
            At depth, air spaces in the body compress—critical for understanding equalization and managing buoyancy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q5: What gas law explains why nitrogen narcosis becomes a risk at depth?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><strong>Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures:</strong> As ambient pressure increases, the partial pressure of
            nitrogen rises, increasing its narcotic effect on the body..</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q6: What equipment consideration is critical for deep diving?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> <strong>Redundant air sources</strong> (e.g., pony bottle, bailout bottle) are critical.
            A <strong>dive computer </strong>with decompression capability and a reliable depth gauge are equa;lly
            critical to deeper diving.
            A backup dive computer is recommended.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q7: How does depth affect air consumption, and how should this factor into dive
          planning?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> Air consumption increases proportionally with pressure. At 99 feet (30 meters), you consume about 4
            times as much air as at the surface.
            You must calculate Rock Bottom gas reserves and plan turn-around pressures accordingly.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q8: What is the maximum partial pressure of oxygen recommended for recreational diving
          to avoid CNS toxicity?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> 1.4 ATA is considered the safe maximum for working portions of the dive; 1.6 ATA may be used briefly for
            decompression stops.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q9: What should you do if you accidentally exceed your no-decompression limit on a
          deep dive?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> Begin emergency decompression stops per your dive computer or table guidelines. <br>
            Example: If you're at 100 feet and exceed the NDL by 5 minutes, perform a deep stop at 50 ft for a few
            minutes is air supply allows, then ascend to 15 feet and hold a prolonged safety stop (often 8+ minutes),
            then surface slowly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q10: How do you manage buoyancy changes more effectively on deep dives?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> Add air <strong></strong>gradually and early </strong> to your BCD when descending to prevent rapid
            descents due to suit and BCD compression. <br>
            Always anticipate buoyancy changes during ascent and vent your BCD (e.g., dump air) as needed to control
            speed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q11: NAUI recommends a weight check prior to diving with new equipment or
          environmental changes (e.g., seawater to freshwater, etc.)
          Too little weight and the diver may not be able to descend or may not be able to hold position at the safety
          stop. What are the risks for too much weight?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> Overweighting adds to your stress in the event of an occurrence requiring extra effort (long surface
            swim, increased currents, wind, buddy needing assistance, etc.).
            Additionally, if the BC malfunctions or fails to hold air, an overweighted diver may be in a dangerous
            situation. If the diver is unable to control descent and is too heavy to ascend,
            then the weight belt must be ditched, and the diver is faced with dealing with too-rapid bouyant ascent.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q12: What are considered valid or reasonable reasons to deep dive?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Some of the reasons to dive deep may include exploration, photography, and marine life identification. Some
            people dive deep as an ego challenge. Our egos are the essence of our quest for adventure. A healthy ego
            gives us confidence, persistence, creativity, and flexibility and is vital to the ability to manage stress.
            But overconfidence (or an unhealthy ego) can lead to errors in judgment or diving beyond limitations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q13: What are the NAUI recommended equipment upgrades for recreational divers that are
          deep diving?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> For dives in the range of 18 to 40 msw (60 to 130 fsw), primary equipment should be upgraded to include
            the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scuba cylinder with minimum capacity of 2200 L (80 cf).
            </li>
            <li>
              Primary cylinder equipped with a “Y” or “H” valved dual regulators, or a separate pony bottle cylinder
              (approx. 425 to 850 L [15 to 30 ft3] ) with its own regulator, which can be mounted to the primary
              cylinder.
            </li>
            <li>
              Two regulators for primary gas source. One may be used on secondary scuba.
              One regulator is to be fitted with a 100 cm (40 in) hose and the other with a hose that is at least 150 cm
              (60 in) long.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q14: When selecting a regulator for deep diving in warmer water, what should be the
          primary concern?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Your first concern is performance. Will the regulator deliver a sufficient gas volume with minimal
            breathing effort under high demands at the
            anticipated maximum dive depth? Keep in mind that your gas flow requirements can more than quadruple in a
            high stress situation.
          </p>
          <p>If applicable, will the regulator perform adequately in cold water or will it ice (resulting in freeflow)
            under high demand conditions?
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q15: Planning your dive profile should involve a little more thinking than just
          choosing a time and depth. What a some of the more important guidelines??
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> Here are a few guidelines to consider:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan the dive </strong> not to exceed the Maximum Dive Time limits of the NAUI Dive Tables.
              These time limits are
              more conservative than the U.S. Navy no-decompression limits. If you are using a dive computer, you may be
              able to make a multi-level dive that is longer than the squarewave time limits. Check the dive planning
              mode of your dive computer.
            <li>
              Make sure the profile is realistically tailored to the underwater terrain and depth.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select a profile that is feasible, considering the air supply and air consumption rate for both you and
              your buddy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take an underwater slate with you, with your primary and contingency profiles written out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dive your plan.</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q16: A diver consumes 100 bar of air from a 12 liter/200 bar tank in 20 minutes at 10
          meters.What is the divers surface air consumption rate?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> The diver consumes 100 bar in 20 minutes at 10 meters, or 5 bar per minute. To compute how much air the
            same diver would consume at the surface, we recall that at 10 methers, the air being breathed is twice as
            dense (twice as many molecules of air).
            At the surface, each breath of air would contain half as many molecules, therefore the diver would consume
            half as much air at the surface.</p>
          </p>The diver at the surface would consume 2.5 liters of air per minute.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q17: Since modern BCs can provide as much as 20 kg (45 lb) of lift, they may be used
          to compensate for overweighting. True or False?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> False
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q18: Conventional recreational equipment will generally be adequate to dives to what
          depth?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> Up to, but not exceeding 40 meters (130 feet)
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q19: What are the restrictions for post-deep-dive activity?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Do not ascend to altitude for 24 hours or more if decompression diving.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the majority of cases of decompression sickness, symptoms manifest in less than two hours following
              the dive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divers should remain with other divers for at least a 3-hour period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Divers should monitor themselves for 24 hours for any unusual symptoms that might suggest decompression
              sickness.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
        </div>


        <button class="accordion">Q20: An air supply that would last 30 minutes on the surface will last the same diver
          how long at a depth of 40 meters (130 feet) of seawater??
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> 6 minutes. </p>
          <p>At the surface, the pressure is 1 ATA. At 40 meters, the pressure is 5 ATA. With a 5x increase in pressure,
            each breath of air is 5 times denser (e.g., 5 times the number of molecules compared to surface breathing).
            Therefore, at 40 meters, air is consumed 5 times faster, and the diver would have 30 minutes / 5 minutes or
            6 minutes.
