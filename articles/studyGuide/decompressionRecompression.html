      <p>As divers transition from rental equipment to their own gear, a solid foundation in dive physics, physiology,
        and marine awareness ensures informed decisions and safer dives.</p>

      <!-- beginning of  Q&A set -->
      <div class="accordion-container">

        <button class="accordion">Q1: Who was John Scott Haldane, and what is his contribution to decompression
          theory?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Haldane developed the first mathematical decompression model in 1908, proposing that inert gases absorbed
            under pressure must be released slowly to prevent decompression sickness (DCS). He introduced the concept of
            tissue compartments and staged decompression.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q2: What are "tissue compartments" in the Haldane model?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Tissue compartments are mathematical representations of how fast or slow different body tissues absorb and
            release inert gases like nitrogen. Each compartment is assigned a half-time for gas uptake and release.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q3: How did Haldane’s model use "multiples of pressure"?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Haldane's model used a maximum allowable supersaturation ratio, where no tissue compartment should exceed
            twice the ambient pressure when surfacing, i.e., a 2:1 ratio, to avoid bubble formation.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q4: What limitation of the Haldane model led to newer theories?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The Haldane model assumes that bubbles don’t form as long as certain pressure ratios aren't exceeded.
            However, real-world data shows that microbubbles can still form even when these limits are respected,
            prompting development of newer models.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q5: How did the U.S. Navy update Haldane’s decompression model?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The U.S. Navy refined the Haldane model using more empirical data from dive experiments. They developed the
            first Navy dive tables and added compartments with different half-times and more conservative
            supersaturation limits.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q6: What are M-values in the Workman model?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>M-values represent the maximum tolerated inert gas pressure in a tissue compartment at a given ambient
            pressure. They define the upper limit of supersaturation before decompression sickness becomes likely.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q7: What innovation did Workman introduce to allow multilevel diving?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Workman developed M-values to enable flexible multilevel dive planning using residual nitrogen levels
            across different depth profiles rather than simple square dives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q8: How does the DCIEM model differ from the U.S. Navy model?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The DCIEM model is based on extensive laboratory and field data, incorporating both perfusion-limited and
            diffusion-limited gas exchange. It is known for being more conservative, particularly on repetitive and deep
            dives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q9: What are DCIEM tables commonly used for?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>DCIEM tables are frequently used by military and commercial divers in Canada and other countries for air
            and mixed-gas diving operations due to their conservative safety profile.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q10: Why are DCIEM models more conservative than U.S. Navy models?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>DCIEM includes more rigorous safety margins and real-time data from test subjects, especially on repetitive
            exposures, making it more cautious in managing nitrogen retention.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q11: Why are dive tables still important in the age of dive computers?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Dive tables help divers understand the underlying theory of decompression and provide a reliable backup in
            case of dive computer failure. They promote good dive planning and conservative practices.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q12: What is a pressure group on a dive table?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A pressure group is a letter code that represents the residual nitrogen level in a diver’s body after a
            dive. It helps determine the necessary surface interval or adjusted no-decompression time for repetitive
            dives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q13: What is Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT)?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>RNT is the amount of nitrogen still present in your body after a dive, expressed in minutes and used to
            adjust bottom time calculations on subsequent dives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q14: What is the maximum allowable bottom time for a no-decompression dive to 80 feet
          using NAUI tables?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The no-decompression limit (NDL) for 80 feet is 30 minutes according to NAUI tables.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q15: A diver does a dive to 70 feet for 25 minutes. What is their pressure
          group?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>According to NAUI tables, the diver would surface in pressure group "H" after this dive.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q16: After 45 minutes of surface interval, what group is the diver now in?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>From group "H" with 45 minutes of surface interval, the diver would be in group "D".</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q17: The diver now descends to 40 feet for 35 minutes. What is the adjusted bottom
          time?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>At 40 feet, with 15 minutes RNT from group "D", the total bottom time is 50 minutes, which is within the
            100-minute NDL for that depth.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q18: What is a "deep stop" and how is it different from a safety stop?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A deep stop is a short pause during ascent, usually halfway to the surface from the maximum depth, used to
            reduce microbubble formation. A safety stop is performed at 15 feet for 3 minutes regardless of depth, as an
            added safety buffer.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q19: Can slower ascents help reduce DCS risk?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, slower ascents allow for more controlled nitrogen off-gassing, helping minimize bubble formation
              and the risk of decompression illness. However, use caution—very slow tissues may still be absorbing gas
              at shallower depths. Divers should monitor their computer's tissue saturation graphs and remaining NDL
              time to avoid unintended overexposure.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q20: Why does RGBM limit reverse profiles?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>RGBM models penalize reverse profiles (going deeper after a shallower dive) due to increased bubble
            formation risk, which standard models may not fully account for.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q21: How does RGBM manage repetitive dives?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>RGBM uses bubble growth control and limits based on prior dive histories to extend surface interval
            requirements and reduce the number of dives per day.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q22: What is the recommended wait time before flying after diving?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>DAN recommends a minimum wait of 12 hours after a single no-decompression dive, 18 hours after multiple
            dives or multiple days of diving, and even longer after decompression dives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q23: How do dive computers improve dive safety?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Dive computers calculate real-time decompression status based on actual dive profiles, allowing for more
            flexible and precise nitrogen tracking than standard dive tables.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q24: What should divers know about algorithm differences in computers?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Different brands use variations of Bühlmann, RGBM, or proprietary algorithms. These vary in conservatism,
            especially on repetitive and multiday dives, and divers should understand their computer's model and safety
            factors.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q25: What does "conservatism setting" mean on a dive computer?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>This setting adjusts how cautiously the computer interprets decompression risk, often adding time to stops
            or limiting bottom time to reduce the chance of DCS.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q26: What is PPO<sub>2</sub> and why is it important in Nitrox diving?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>PPO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure of oxygen) indicates how much oxygen is being absorbed at depth. A
            PPO<sub>2</sub> above 1.4 ATA during the working portion of a dive increases the risk of oxygen toxicity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q27: What is the advantage of using Nitrox on multiple daily dives?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Nitrox has less nitrogen than air, which lowers nitrogen absorption per dive, reducing the risk of DCS,
            especially for repetitive dives with short surface intervals.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q28: What is the maximum operating depth (MOD) for EANx32?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The MOD for EANx32 at a PPO<sub>2</sub> limit of 1.4 ATA is 111 feet. Exceeding this depth increases the
            risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q29: How can divers calculate PPO<sub>2</sub> at depth?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>PPO<sub>2</sub> = FO<sub>2</sub> × ATA. For example, diving to 99 feet (4 ATA) on EANx36 (0.36
            O<sub>2</sub>) results in a PPO<sub>2</sub> of 1.44 ATA, exceeding the recommended working limit of 1.4.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q30: What’s the risk of exceeding a PPO<sub>2</sub> of 1.6?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Exceeding 1.6 ATA increases the risk of convulsions and blackout due to oxygen toxicity, which can be fatal
            underwater.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q31: What is the first response to suspected DCS or AGE?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Administer 100% oxygen immediately, keep the diver horizontal and calm, monitor vital signs, and transport
            them to a hyperbaric facility without delay.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q32: What is the role of a hyperbaric chamber in dive emergencies?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy re-compresses the diver and flushes nitrogen from tissues under high-pressure
            oxygen, aiding in symptom reversal and tissue recovery.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q33: What are other decompression aids besides oxygen?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Besides oxygen and recompression therapy, hydration, warmth, horizontal positioning, and prompt medical
            evaluation are critical in mitigating decompression injuries.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q34: How do you manually calculate MOD in feet for a Nitrox mix?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Use the formula MOD (ft) = [(PPO₂ limit / FO₂) - 1] × 33. For EANx32 and a PPO₂ of 1.4: [(1.4 / 0.32) - 1]
            × 33 = 111 feet.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q35: How do you manually calculate MOD in meters for a Nitrox mix?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Use the formula MOD (m) = [(PPO₂ limit / FO₂) - 1] × 10. For EANx32 and a PPO₂ of 1.4: [(1.4 / 0.32) - 1] ×
            10 = 24.75 meters.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q36: What is the difference between no-decompression limits (NDL) and decompression
          ceilings?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>NDL is the maximum time a diver can stay at depth without mandatory decompression stops. A decompression
            ceiling is the shallowest depth a diver can ascend to without violating required decompression obligations,
            common in technical diving profiles.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q37: What are microbubbles, and why are they important in decompression
          models?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Microbubbles are tiny inert gas bubbles that form in tissues during ascent. While often asymptomatic, their
            accumulation can lead to DCS. Models like RGBM aim to minimize these through slower ascents and deep stops.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q38: How does dehydration affect decompression safety?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Dehydration reduces blood volume and impairs tissue perfusion, slowing inert gas elimination and increasing
            DCS risk. Divers should hydrate before and after dives, especially in warm climates or during multiple dive
            days.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q39: Why do older divers or those with higher body fat have increased DCS
          risk?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Fat stores absorb more nitrogen, and older individuals may have reduced circulation and slower off-gassing.
            These factors can increase DCS risk during repetitive or deep dives.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q40: How do cold water dives affect nitrogen uptake and decompression risk?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Cold causes peripheral vasoconstriction, directing blood to the core. This limits nitrogen uptake in limbs
            but increases it in central tissues. Cold also slows off-gassing, making conservative profiles essential.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q41: What are the pros and cons of multi-level dive planning?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Multi-level dives reduce nitrogen loading by ascending gradually and spending less time at maximum depth.
            However, without a computer or proper planning, they can lead to underestimation of accumulated nitrogen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q42: How should you plan repetitive dives over multiple days?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Use conservative dive profiles, extend surface intervals, track residual nitrogen and CNS oxygen exposure
            (for Nitrox), and remain hydrated. </p>
            <p>Plan deeper dives first, followed by shallower ones later in the day or
            trip.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q43: What is a dive profile simulator, and why should every diver try one?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>A simulator allows divers to preview profiles and visualize nitrogen loading and ascent behavior. It’s a
            great tool for training, risk assessment, and understanding decompression theory in real time.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q44: How do surface interval credit rules differ between NAUI, PADI, and RGBM
          tables?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>NAUI tables tend to offer longer surface interval credits than PADI. RGBM uses bubble dynamics, often
            requiring longer intervals and penalizing fast repetitive dives. Understanding your model’s assumptions is
            key.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q45: What are early signs of decompression sickness every diver should know?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Early signs include joint/muscle pain, fatigue, tingling, dizziness, itching, and skin rash. More severe
            symptoms involve numbness, weakness, or confusion. Any symptom post-dive should prompt oxygen administration
            and medical evaluation.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q46: How does altitude diving affect decompression calculations?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>At altitude, the ambient pressure is lower, reducing pressure gradients and affecting nitrogen off-gassing.
            Divers must use altitude-adjusted tables or computers capable of calculating at elevation to avoid DCS.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q47: Why should divers avoid physical exertion immediately after diving?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Physical activity increases circulation, potentially transporting gas bubbles to sensitive tissues. Light
            activity may help off-gassing, but heavy exertion too soon post-dive increases DCS risk.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q48: What is the role of oxygen in surface interval recovery?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Breathing pure oxygen between dives accelerates nitrogen elimination by increasing the pressure gradient
            and displacing nitrogen in the lungs. It's sometimes used in technical diving surface protocols.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q49: What is a CNS oxygen toxicity clock, and how is it tracked?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The CNS clock tracks cumulative oxygen exposure based on PPO<sub>2</sub> and time. A 100% CNS exposure
            (based on NOAA limits) is considered the safe daily maximum. Dive computers or manual tables can be used to
            track it.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Q50: Why does NOAA recommend a PPO<sub>2</sub> limit of 1.6 ATA for contingency
          only?</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>1.6 ATA is the emergency maximum. It’s acceptable for short exposures during decompression stops, but not
            recommended for working portions of dives due to increased seizure risk. </p>
          <p> Planned dives should stay below 1.4
            ATA PPO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
