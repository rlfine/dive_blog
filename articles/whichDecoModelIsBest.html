    <h2>Which Decompression Model Is Better? A Look at Bühlmann, DCIEM, and RGBM</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Decompression theory is a cornerstone of dive safety. Behind every dive computer is a model that tries to
        predict how inert gases like nitrogen or helium are absorbed and released by the body—and, crucially, how to
        avoid decompression sickness (DCS). Over the past century, researchers have worked tirelessly to make diving
        safer, refining models that we often take for granted today.</p>

      <p>But here’s a question divers regularly ask: <strong>Is one decompression model better than the others?</strong>
        We might assume that because models are different, one must be superior. Yet the answer is more nuanced than it
        appears.</p>

      <p>Let’s explore the major players: <strong>Bühlmann ZHL</strong>, <strong>DCIEM</strong>, and
        <strong>RGBM</strong>, their theoretical foundations, and how to think about “better” when it comes to
        decompression safety.</p>
    </section>


    <h3>Bühlmann ZHL: The Classic Dissolved Gas Model</h3>
    <section>
      <p>Albert Bühlmann’s ZHL (Zurich-Haldane) series of algorithms are arguably the most widely used decompression
        models in recreational and technical diving. Based on Haldane’s early work (1908), Bühlmann developed
        <em>multi-compartment models</em> that calculate how different tissues absorb and release inert gases at varying
        rates.</p>

      <p>The key idea? As long as the <strong>partial pressure gradient</strong> between a diver’s tissues and ambient
        pressure is kept within certain limits, a diver can ascend safely.</p>

      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Well-validated and widely adopted.</li>
        <li>Mathematically transparent and tunable (e.g., with Gradient Factors).</li>
        <li>Suitable for a wide range of diving—from recreational to deep technical.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not directly model <em>bubble formation</em>.</li>
        <li>Assumes that if you control dissolved gas load, bubbles won’t be a problem—a simplification of real-world
          physiology.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>DCIEM: Bubble-Informed Conservatism</h3>
    <section>
    <p>The <strong>Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine (DCIEM)</strong> model, developed in Canada,
      adds an extra layer of validation. It still uses multi-compartment inert gas kinetics but <strong>calibrates
        decompression limits using Doppler ultrasound bubble data.</strong></p>

    <p>In other words, DCIEM didn’t just model how inert gas dissolves and off-gasses; it also <em>observed</em> bubble
      formation in real divers and adjusted limits accordingly.</p>

    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Incorporates <em>empirical data</em> on actual bubble formation.</li>
      <li>Designed and proven effective in <em>cold water and military-grade conditions</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conservative and sometimes restrictive.</li>
      <li>Doppler-detectable bubbles don’t always lead to DCS—so conservative limits may not reflect exact personal
        risk.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>RGBM: Bubble-Centric Decompression</h3>
    <section>
      <p>Bruce Wienke’s <strong>Reduced Gradient Bubble Model (RGBM)</strong> arose from the realization that
        <strong>microbubbles form in divers even when dissolved gas limits are respected.</strong> RGBM explicitly
        integrates <em>bubble physics</em>, aiming to reduce bubble formation, limit bubble growth, and focus on the
        entire <em>bubble lifecycle.</em></p>

      <p>RGBM supports concepts like <strong>deep stops</strong> and <strong>slower ascents</strong>, based on the idea
        that controlling bubbles early in the ascent may reduce overall decompression stress.</p>

      <p><strong>Strengths:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focuses on <em>bubble prevention</em> as well as dissolved gas.</li>
        <li>Incorporates real-world considerations like repetitive dives and multi-day exposures.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Less mathematically transparent (proprietary elements).</li>
        <li>Some studies and field experience have questioned the necessity—and in some cases the safety—of extended
          deep stops.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>So, Which Model Is Better?</h2>
    <section>

      <p>It’s tempting to think that one model must be objectively superior. After all, each approaches the problem
        differently:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bühlmann:</strong> Focuses on dissolved gas control.</li>
        <li><strong>DCIEM:</strong> Adds empirical bubble monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>RGBM:</strong> Prioritizes bubble suppression from the outset.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But here’s the catch: <strong>No model is perfect.</strong> Each is designed around the <em>average diver</em>,
        and as divers, we know there’s no such thing as an “average human body.” Some divers might handle five 100-foot
        dives in a row with no issue, while another diver could face serious decompression illness under the same
        profile.</p>

      <p>Moreover, <strong>diving is probabilistic, not deterministic.</strong> Models manage <em>risk</em>—they don’t
        guarantee safety. Most decompression models have success rates around 98%+ for healthy, hydrated divers under
        standard conditions. But small variations in physiology, hydration, circulation, and environmental factors can
        push an individual diver outside the model’s safe assumptions.</p>

      <p>So, rather than asking <strong>“Which is best?”</strong> a better question might be:<br>
        <strong>“Which is most appropriate for my dive profile, environment, and personal risk tolerance?”</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Bringing It All Together: Safe, Sane, and Respectful Diving</h2>
    <section>

      <p>The science of decompression has come <strong>a long way</strong>, and every model—whether it’s Bühlmann,
        DCIEM, or RGBM—deserves our appreciation for making diving safer than ever before.</p>

      <p>The most effective strategy to minimize DCS risk is not just picking the “best” model but:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Diving <strong>conservatively</strong> (e.g., Gradient Factors of 30/70 or 40/80 for Bühlmann).</li>
        <li>Maintaining excellent <strong>hydration, fitness, and warmth.</strong></li>
        <li>Using <strong>adequate surface intervals.</strong></li>
        <li>Being alert to <strong>your own body’s signals</strong> and erring on the side of caution.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Diving, at its best, blends adventure with respect—for both the underwater world and our own limits.</p>
