        <h1>Gas Theory and Scuba Diving</h1>
        <p>Exploring the science and safety of scuba diving.</p>
    </header>

    <article>
        <p>When we descend beneath the waves, we are not just exploring the underwater world — we are entering a realm where gas physics governs every moment of the dive...</p>

        <h2>What Is Gas Theory?</h2>
        <p>Gas theory refers to the scientific study of how gases behave under different conditions of pressure, temperature, and volume...</p>

        <h2>Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures</h2>
        <p>Dalton’s Law states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each individual gas...</p>

        <h2>Boyle’s Law</h2>
        <p>At a constant temperature, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure applied to it...</p>

        <h2>Charles’ Law</h2>
        <p>At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature...</p>

        <h2>Henry’s Law</h2>
        <p>The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the liquid...</p>

        <h2>Amontons’ Law (Gay-Lussac’s Law)</h2>
        <p>At constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature...</p>

        <h2>The General Gas Law</h2>
        <p>Combines Boyle’s, Charles’, and Amontons’ Laws into one relationship involving pressure, volume, and temperature.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: Mastering the Invisible World</h2>
        <p>Every breath underwater is governed by gas laws. Mastering gas theory gives divers the ability to plan safer dives, respond intelligently to emergencies, and appreciate the unseen yet powerful forces at play beneath the surface.</p>
