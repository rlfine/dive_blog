    <h2>Introduction – Why ODIGTML Has Multiple Meanings</h2>
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        If you're a NAUI diver or especially a dive leader in training, you may have encountered the acronym
        <strong>ODIGTML</strong>
        in more than one setting—sometimes meaning one thing, and sometimes another. That’s not a mistake, and it’s not
        sloppy instruction. It’s actually a feature of how NAUI teaches <em>context-driven dive planning</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The acronym <strong>ODIGTML</strong> is intentionally reused in two distinct frameworks:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk-Based Dive Planning</strong> – where ODIGTML serves as a checklist to identify and mitigate
          dive hazards</li>
        <li><strong>Dive Group Planning</strong> – where ODIGTML helps teams structure a safe, organized, collaborative
          dive</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        While most acronyms strive for a single unambiguous meaning, NAUI appears to have made a pedagogical choice to
        reuse ODIGTML across domains because the letters still represent **seven planning pillars**, regardless of
        context. Instead of trying to teach two completely different acronyms for different types of dives, this reuse
        reinforces the idea that dive planning—whether for a team or a technical challenge—should always involve
        structured thinking across multiple categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        So rather than seeing ODIGTML's dual use as a flaw, think of it as a mental tool that adapts to your
        environment. Same structure, different lens. What follows are two fully explained versions of ODIGTML, each
        matched to its planning context.

      <summary>ODIGTML (Risk-Based) – A Guide to Identify and Mitigate Dive Risks</summary>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>O – Oxygen</h4>
        <p>Evaluate PPO₂ exposure, MOD for Nitrox, CNS % tracking, and oxygen toxicity risk (CNS and pulmonary).</p>

        <h4>D – Decompression</h4>
        <p>Review NDL status or deco obligation, ascent rates, stop profiles, and algorithm or dive computer settings.
        </p>

        <h4>I – Inert Gas Narcosis</h4>
        <p>Assess narcosis risk at planned depth. Consider diver experience, mental readiness, and use of trimix if
          needed.</p>

        <h4>G – Gas Management</h4>
        <p>Calculate RMV/SAC, gas needed for descent, task load, ascent, reserve. Include turn pressure and bailout gas.
        </p>

        <h4>T – Thermal</h4>
        <p>Evaluate exposure suit needs based on water temperature and duration. Monitor for hypothermia or overheating.
        </p>

        <h4>M – Mission</h4>
        <p>Define the primary task (e.g., lift bag use, photo survey). Consider complexity and whether dive is
          abortable.</p>

        <h4>L – Logistics</h4>
        <p>Surface support, DAN O₂ kits, emergency response plan, chamber access, communications, extra gas or food.</p>

        <div class="note">
          The <strong>risk-assessment</strong> interpretation of ODIGTML is introduced in NAUI Advanced and Master Scuba
          Diver courses particularly in modules that emphasize hazard awareness, gas planning, and complex exposure
          management. <br><br>This version frames ODIGTML as a checklist for evaluating the seven core risk categories on any
          dive:
          <ul>
            <li><u>O</u>xygen exposure, </li>
            <li><u>D</u>ecompression planning, </li>
            <li><u>I</u>nert gas narcosis, </li>
            <li><u>G</u>as availability, </li>
            <li><u>T</u>hermal protection, </li>
            <li><u>M</u>ission complexity, and </li>
            <li><u>L</u>ogistical support.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>ODIGTML (Dive Group Planning) – A Guide for Group Dive Planning</summary>
      <div class="section">
        <h4>O – Objective</h4>
        <p>Define the purpose of the dive. Example: Navigation practice, search & recovery training, fun dive, etc.</p>

        <h4>D – Dive Site Description</h4>
        <p>Identify site name, access method, conditions (depth, temperature, visibility), and known hazards.</p>

        <h4>I – Individual & Team Roles</h4>
        <p>Assign tasks: dive leader, buddy teams, equipment carriers, timing/depth monitors, etc.</p>

        <h4>G – Gear Requirements</h4>
        <p>List required equipment: wetsuits/drysuits, tanks, slates, SMBs, compasses, special tools.</p>

        <h4>T – Time, Depth & Profile</h4>
        <p>Plan max depth, bottom time, safety stop, ascent rate, dive profile (square, multi-level), and turn
          pressures.</p>

        <h4>M – Method of Dive</h4>
        <p>Describe entry/exit strategy, compass headings, signal use, task sequence, emergency abort criteria.</p>

        <h4>L – Logistics</h4>
        <p>List surface support, O₂ kits, transportation, gas fills, dive window, meals, weather watch, and check-in
          protocol.</p>

        <p class="note">The ODIGTML <strong>group planning model</strong> is introduced in NAUI Leadership-level
          coursework, particularly
          in the NAUI Divemaster and Instructor Training programs. It provides a structured, seven-part planning
          framework designed to ensure dive teams address objective, site, personnel, gear, timing, methods, and
          logistics.
          <br> <br>
          While first introduced in the entry level courses, the two versions or interpretations serve different
          pedagogical purposes. NAUI's intentional reuse of ODIGTML in leadership courses reinforces the habit of
          structured, multi-factor planning in both recreational and technical settings. It is expected that by
          the time divers get to leadership levels, they will see and appreciate the reuse and not be caught up in the
          confusion of multiple meanings and interpretations.
