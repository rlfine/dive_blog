<h1>Field Tuning Your Regulator: Reducing Work of Breathing</h1>

<p>During a recent week-long dive trip to the Caribbean, I personally experienced a phenomenon that many older divers will recognize: the increasing difficulty of breathing comfortably on consecutive deep dives. While younger dive buddies seem unaffected, the effects of <strong>increased work of breathing (WOB)</strong> became apparent after multiple 80–100 foot dives over several days. Here’s why it happens — and how you can address it with a simple field adjustment.</p>

<h2>Understanding Work of Breathing at Depth</h2>
<section>
<p>As depth increases, the density of breathing gas increases proportionally. Breathing air at 90 feet feels significantly "thicker" than at the surface, making inhalation more laborious. Older divers may experience this sooner due to natural age-related changes, including decreased lung elasticity and diaphragm strength, coupled with increased CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity.</p>
</section>

<h2>Why a Poorly Tuned Regulator Makes It Worse</h2>
<section>
<p>A second stage regulator that is improperly tuned — requiring high cracking effort — can make breathing far more difficult at depth. Even a regulator that seems fine at the surface can become noticeably restrictive at 80–100 feet. This extra resistance compounds over multiple dives, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and even CO<sub>2</sub> retention symptoms.</p>
</section>

<h2>Simple Field Test: Bucket or Sink Method</h2>
<section>
<p>You can easily check your second stage's cracking effort using only a bucket or sink:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lightly pressurize the regulator by opening the tank valve.</li>
<li>Hold the second stage with the mouthpiece facing down.</li>
<li>Slowly lower it into water and observe when it starts to freeflow.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If water just barely touches the purge button before freeflow: <strong>Excellent, easy breathing.</strong></li>
<li>If water covers the purge button 1/4–1/2 inch before freeflow: <strong>Good, acceptable breathing effort.</strong></li>
<li>If you must submerge it over 1 inch before freeflow: <strong>Too tight — regulator needs adjustment.</strong></li>
</ul>

</section>

<h2>Field Fine-Tuning Technique</h2>

<section>
p>If your second stage cracking effort is too high, you can make minor field adjustments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Locate the adjustment screw (typically near the hose inlet).</li>
<li>Turn <strong>counterclockwise</strong> 1/8 turn to <strong>reduce cracking effort</strong> (easier breathing).</li>
<li>Turn <strong>clockwise</strong> 1/8 turn to <strong>increase cracking effort</strong> (prevent freeflow if too loose).</li>
<li>Re-test using the water bucket method after each small adjustment.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Important:</em> Never loosen more than 1/2 turn without full service. Always prioritize safety and stability over an ultra-light breathing feel if unsure.</p>
</section>

<h2>Why This Matters for Older Divers</h2>

<section>
<p>As we age, even very healthy divers will experience increased breathing effort sooner, especially on repetitive deep diving days. Fine-tuning your second stage can dramatically improve comfort, reduce fatigue, and minimize the risk of CO<sub>2</sub> buildup — making your dive days safer and far more enjoyable.</p>
