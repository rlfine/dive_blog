    <h2>Pioneers of Decompression Theory: The Architects Behind Modern Dive Safety</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Modern dive safety owes a tremendous debt to the researchers and scientists who developed decompression theory
        over the last century. These pioneers laid the groundwork for the models we use today—models that allow divers
        to safely explore the underwater world while managing the risks of decompression sickness (DCS). Below is a
        tribute to some of the most influential contributors.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>John Scott Haldane (1860–1936)</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Developed the first <em>scientific decompression tables</em> for the British
        Royal Navy in 1908. He introduced the concept of <em>half-times</em> for different tissue compartments and the
        idea of limiting pressure reduction to a critical supersaturation ratio (initially 2:1).</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Widely regarded as the father of modern decompression theory, setting the stage for
        all later developments.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Albert R. Behnke (1903–1992)</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Advanced U.S. Navy diving tables and pioneered the <em>oxygen window</em>
        concept, promoting oxygen use in decompression to enhance inert gas elimination.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> Pushed forward oxygen-based decompression strategies still in use today.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Robert D. Workman (1917–1984)</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Introduced <strong>M-values</strong>, which define the maximum inert gas
        pressures allowable in tissues. He refined the U.S. Navy decompression tables and formalized supersaturation
        limits for operational use.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> His M-value framework remains foundational to many decompression algorithms.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Albert A. Bühlmann (1923–1994)</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Developed the <em>Bühlmann ZHL series</em> algorithms, which are the basis
        of many modern dive computers. He expanded decompression research to include <strong>altitude diving</strong>
        and introduced methods for adjusting for lower ambient pressures.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> His work remains a gold standard for decompression modeling, with widespread global
        adoption.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Bruce Wienke (1940– )</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Created the <em>Reduced Gradient Bubble Model (RGBM)</em>, integrating
        bubble dynamics with dissolved gas models to minimize bubble formation and growth.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> RGBM brought bubble physics to mainstream diving algorithms, influencing many dive
        computers and technical diving protocols.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>David Yount (1930–2000)</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Developed the <em>Varying Permeability Model (VPM)</em>, focusing on how
        bubble nuclei form, persist, and change in response to pressure.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> VPM is widely used in technical diving, especially for deep decompression dives.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Erik Baker</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Developed the <em>Gradient Factors (GF)</em> method, allowing divers to
        adjust conservatism in Bühlmann-based dive computers by selecting how closely to approach critical tissue
        limits.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> GF settings are now standard in most technical dive computers, giving divers
        flexibility to fine-tune their decompression strategy.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Robert D. Nishi (1941–2014)</h3>
    <section>
      <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Led the development of the <strong>DCIEM decompression tables</strong> in
        Canada, using empirical Doppler ultrasound bubble data to fine-tune decompression limits for military and
        commercial divers.</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy:</strong> His bubble-informed models have a proven safety record, particularly in cold-water and
        demanding operational environments.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Honoring Their Legacy</h2>

    <section>
      <p>While each of these pioneers contributed unique insights—whether focusing on dissolved gas kinetics, bubble
        dynamics, or empirical validation—they all shared a common goal: to make diving safer. Thanks to their work,
        today’s divers benefit from decades of research, innovation, and real-world experience.</p>
