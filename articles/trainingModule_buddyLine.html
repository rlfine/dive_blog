            <div class="contentIndented">

                <h3>A. Buddy Line Fundamentals & Expectations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Line Tension Norms:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The line should be <em>neither tight nor excessively slack</em>.</li>
                            <li>A slightly loose line is normal due to differing kick cycles.</li>
                            <li>A momentarily taut line is not a signal unless deliberately held.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tugs are valid only when the line is intentionally pulled taut.</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Buddy Roles Defined:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lead diver:</strong> sets direction, paces swim, initiates “ping” check-ins.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Follower:</strong> maintains formation, responds to pings, and signals issues.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>B. Communication Protocol Practice</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use a <strong>tug only when the line is taut</strong>; tugs on slack lines are ignored.</li>
                    <li>Practice ping-response (1 tug each) to simulate OK checks in low visibility.</li>
                    <li>Rehearse all 4 signal types with eyes closed or blindfolded:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1 Tug:</strong> Ping / Are you OK?</li>
                            <li><strong>2 Tugs:</strong> Attention / Pause and meet up</li>
                            <li><strong>3 Tugs:</strong> Alert / Emergency or critical issue</li>
                            <li><strong>No Response:</strong> Prompt immediate reconnection</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Part 2: In-Water Exercises</h2>

            <div class="contentIndented">
                <p>Each of these scenarios builds on the dryland practice and should be conducted in confined or
                    open
                    water under instructor supervision. Reinforce proper communication, buddy discipline, and
                    problem-solving in a realistic, low-visibility context.</p>

                <h3>Scenario 1: Communication Validation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead diver performs periodic <strong>ping checks (1 tug)</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Follower responds with <strong>1 tug if OK</strong>; if no response is received, Lead
                        initiates
                        proximity check.</li>
                    <li>Instructor inserts a planned <strong>Attention (2 tugs)</strong> requiring meetup and
                        slate-based communication.</li>
                    <li>Follow with a scripted <strong>Alert (3 tugs)</strong> to simulate emergency signaling and
                        reaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scenario 2: Dropped Line Recovery</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One diver (Follower) simulates unintentionally releasing the buddy line.</li>
                    <li>Lead detects slackness through change in resistance or missing feedback.</li>
                    <li>Divers stop, maintain buoyancy, and use tactile search or line sweep to reconnect.</li>
                    <li>Debrief emphasizes line awareness, reaction time, and clear reconnection protocol.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scenario 3: Snagged Line Obstruction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Line is routed around or under a structure (e.g., platform leg or piling).</li>
                    <li>As divers approach, tension signals a snag condition.</li>
                    <li>Divers halt, backtrack in sync, and collaborate to free the line from the obstruction.</li>
                    <li>Instructor assesses whether the snag was recognized early and resolved calmly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Scenario 4: Navigation Swim (Low Viz Simulation)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lead diver uses compass to follow a predetermined out-and-back or U-pattern course.</li>
                    <li>Team maintains correct spacing on buddy line with no visual cues allowed.</li>
                    <li>Ping checks are performed at intervals.</li>
                    <li>Instructor introduces one Attention and one Alert scenario during the navigation to test
                        situational control.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

            <h3>C. Simulated Drills</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Tug Drill (Eyes Closed):</strong> Alternate sending/receiving each type of signal. Validate
                    only tugs on taut line.</li>
                <li><strong>Dropped Line:</strong> One diver simulates releasing the line. Buddy detects slack and
                    initiates recovery.</li>
                <li><strong>Snagged Line:</strong> Line is routed under/around a chair or obstacle. Divers coordinate to
                    recognize tension, reverse, and clear the snag.</li>
                <li><strong>Role Swap Drill:</strong> Swap Lead and Follower roles mid-simulation to ensure both divers
                    are competent in both positions.</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Perform these skills until they become familiar and can be handled with minimal (preferrably NO) mistakes
            or confusion. Perform these skills on dry-land, then in open water where visibility is not obscured, and
            then finally, under instructor supervision, exercise these skills in low-visibility environments.
        </p>
        <p>NOTE: diving with a buddy line is not something that you would typically do with a new buddy on a first
            dive. However, if you are diving with a new buddy in a low-visibility environment, consider using the
            buddy line, and also it is strongly suggested that you and your buddy practice the buddy-line skills
            prior to jumping in on a low-visibility dive.
        </p>

            <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #005977;">⚠️ Practice Recommendation</h3>
            <p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
                Perform these skills until they become familiar and can be handled with minimal (preferably
                <strong>NO</strong>) mistakes or confusion. Start on dry land, then practice in open water with good
                visibility, and finally apply <em>under instructor supervision </em> in a <strong>low-visibility
                    environments</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> Diving with a buddy line is not something you'd typically do with a new buddy on
                a first dive. Neither is diving with a new buddy in a limited- or low-visibility environment.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-left:2em;">
                However, if you <em>must</em> dive with a new buddy in limited visibility, using a buddy line is highly
                recommended. Be sure to rehearse buddy-line procedures together before entering the water.
