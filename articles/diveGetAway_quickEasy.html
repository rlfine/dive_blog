            <h2>Diving Cozumel vs. Roatán: Two Caribbean Giants Compared</h2>
            <p>
                Many divers are familiar with <strong>Cozumel</strong>, a cruise ship favorite and world-renowned for
                its swift drift dives and vibrant reef walls. But just across the Caribbean lies
                <strong>Roatán</strong>, an island gem with calmer waters, lush coral gardens, and a slower pace that
                many divers—especially those seeking more intentional exploration—come to appreciate deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you like your diving fast and furious, <strong>Cozumel</strong> delivers. Its legendary drift dives
                feel like riding a <em>speedy subway from station to station</em>, offering a thrilling tour of
                underwater highlights (albeit sometimes blurred by the speed of the currents) with little need to kick.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you prefer to slow down and “<em>smell the roses</em>” from time to
                time—or if you’re tired of fighting current to maintain buddy contact—<strong>Roatán</strong> offers a
                more relaxed diving experience, with equally impressive coral, macro life, and fewer crowds.

                <strong>Verdict:</strong> Cozumel is slightly easier to access from major Texas airports, but Roatán is
                still very reachable with a little planning—and well worth it for a quieter, less touristy vibe.

            </table>
            <p>
                <strong>Verdict:</strong> Cozumel offers adrenaline and big visuals; Roatán invites you to slow down and
                take in the details. For divers who want to maximize bottom time and mindfulness, Roatán is a top pick.

            <h3>When to Go: Best Seasons for Diving</h3>
            <p>
                Both Cozumel and Roatán offer year-round diving, but conditions do vary seasonally due to weather,
                visibility, and crowds.
                Planning your trip during peak dive seasons can greatly enhance your experience—while avoiding hurricane
                season can help
                you steer clear of rough seas and reduced operations.

                    crowding.</li>
                <li><strong>Cozumel</strong> is ideal from <strong>December through April</strong>, but tends to be
                    busier with tourists.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid September–October</strong> for both destinations due to hurricane season and reduced
                    resort activity.</li>
                <li><strong>Whale shark sightings</strong> are possible near Roatán/Utila from March to May—an added
                    bonus for spring divers.</li>

            <h3>🌴 Local Advice: Stay Clear of the Cruise Ports</h3>
            <p>
                Roatán has two major cruise ship terminals — <strong>Mahogany Bay</strong> and <strong>Port of Roatán
                    (Coxen Hole)</strong> — both located on the island's southwestern coast. While convenient for short
                excursions, these areas are <strong>not ideal for serious divers</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The best dive resorts are purposefully located <strong>20 to 45 minutes away</strong> from the cruise
                crowds, giving you access to uncrowded reefs, relaxed surface intervals, and dive-focused
                accommodations.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://anthonyskey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony’s Key Resort</a> – North
                    shore, ~25 mins from port</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.cocoviewresort.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CocoView Resort</a> – South
                    shore, ~35 mins from port</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.turquoisebayresort.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turquoise Bay
                        Resort</a> – Remote northeast, ~45 mins from port</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Tip:</strong> If tranquility, repeat diving, and reef preservation matter to you, head away from
                the ports and toward Roatán’s true dive destinations.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>
                Both Cozumel and Roatán offer spectacular diving and unique experiences.
            </p>
            <p> If you're after fast currents, big swim-bys, and a wide selection of flights there and back from Texas,
                Cozumel delivers.
            </p>
            <p>But if you're drawn to the art of underwater observation, where you can pause, hover, and really connect
                with the reef, Roatán may just become your new favorite dive destination.
