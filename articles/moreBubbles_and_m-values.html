        <h2>Timeline: Evolution of Decompression Safety Limits</h2>

        <section>
            <p><em>1908 â€“ Haldaneâ€™s 2:1 Pressure Ratio</em></p>


            <p><strong>John Scott Haldane</strong> published the first staged decompression model based on goat
                experiments. He proposed that tissues could safely tolerate a nitrogen load of up to <strong>2 times the
                    ambient pressure</strong> without forming harmful bubbles. This 2:1 ratio applied uniformly to all
                tissues and formed the foundation of early Navy and commercial diving tables.

            <p>âš“ Mid-20th Century â€“ U.S. Navy Reduces to 1.58:1</p>
            <p>Further U.S. Navy dive research revealed that the 2:1 ratio was too aggressive for certain tissues,
                especially slow-saturating compartments like fat and marrow. They revised the maximum allowable pressure
                differential to about <strong>1.58:1</strong>, still applied universally across all tissue compartments.
            </p>

            <p>ðŸ“Š 1965 â€“ Workman Introduces M-Values</p>
            <p><strong>Robert D. Workman</strong> introduced a more refined model that calculated
                <strong>tissue-specific inert gas limits</strong> known as <strong>M-values</strong>. These values vary
                by tissue compartment and depth, representing the maximum safe nitrogen pressure for each tissue at any
                given ambient pressure. His work shifted decompression modeling from a fixed pressure ratio to a
                flexible, physics-based ceiling model, forming the basis for modern dive computers and tables.
