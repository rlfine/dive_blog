        <h2>When Your “Buddy” Isn’t a Buddy at All</h2>

        <p>Why am I revisitng a topic that has already been proverbially beaten to death? A couple of reasons, and we
            will
            address them in brief here.
        </p>

        <p>While perusing recent DAN diver safety articles, I came across an article that showed the recreational diver
            death rate has been approximatley 80 per year, with a recent uptick in occurrances. That caught me by
            surprise, because I had the feeling we were getting much better at recreational diver training. Everyone has
            a $450+ dive computer, so no one should ever miss a safety stop or exceed the no-decompression-limits. With
            air integration and a GTR visual with alerts, no diver should ever run out of air again. However, equipment
            failures were not the driver - it was divers not using the most important piece of equipment correctly - the
            brain, or more correctly, good judgement!.
        </p>

        <p>The common theme across the majority of diver deaths, according to DAN, points to health and judgment under
            stress—<strong>not missing skills</strong>—as the big drivers. </p>

        <p>Without question - Better training helps (especially realistic stress drills, gas planning, ascent control),
            but the biggest levers are:
        <ul>
            <li>fitness/cardiac screening,</li>
            <li>conservative dive choices, and </li>
            <li>culture (calling the dive early, buddy discipline, regular refreshers). </li>
        </ul>
        DAN’s 2018–2020 narratives emphasize older age mix, comorbidities, and
        out-of-gas/rapid-ascent chains, not lack of exposure to the basic curriculum. </p>

        <h2>Anecdotal - but it really happened</h2>
        <p>On a recent Advanced Diver training course, I was paired with what I can only describe as one that was
            operating very close to being the worst buddy I’ve ever had. I'm not into confrontations or diver-shaming.
            I'm not the best dive buddy - but I try to be. I write this only to bring attention to what I consider one
            of the greatest safety features of diving - the buddy system. Additionally, to point out that the
            buddy-system is not perfect, and needs proactive attention for it work for you.</p>

        <h3>How it all started</h3>

        <p>During a low-visibility dive to 60 feet, my buddy abruptly left without warning, surfaced alone, and returned
            to shore. I noticed he wasn’t behind me, initiated a search, and after failing to locate him, alerted our
            DM. We searched together for about a minute before I suggested he continue searching underwater while I
            surfaced to check above.</p>

        <p>At 60 feet and with 10 minutes of bottom time, I wasn’t ready for a straight-to-the-surface ascent due to
            Nitrogen off-gassing obligation, but the possibility my buddy needed help made me shorten my safety stop.
            There was some risk, but I knew I would survive. When I surfaced, I found him already out of his gear,
            sitting comfortably on shore. I don't mind making a rushed ascent for a good cause, and every second of my
            ascent I was thinking of that sign flashing in my head - <strong>Two divers in trouble is worse than one
            </strong> - but this one was totally unnecessary.
        </p>

        <h3>And Again</h3>

        <p>Same diver, same course: during a simulated decompression stop at a 30-foot platform, the diver failed to
            switch to the second stage regulator on the staged deco bottle, took in some water, panicked, and attempted
            to bolt to the surface. The DM grabbed his fins, pulled him back, calmed him down, and helped him finish the
            drill safely (more importantly, <strong>a quick thinking DM prevented a diver from making a breath holding
                panic ascent to the surface</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>This diver wasn’t new to life (and full-disclosure, I am far from same myself), but he was clearly new to
            calm, controlled decision-making under stress. Should he have been certified as an Advanced Diver? I have my
            doubts, but that's not my call. The bigger question is — where does the responsibility lie?</p>

        <details>
            <summary>1. What Agency Standards Require</summary>
            <p>Training agencies define skill performance standards for each course, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Demonstrating basic and advanced skills to a performance criterion</li>
                <li>Showing adequate buddy awareness and teamwork</li>
                <li>Managing common emergency scenarios (e.g., out-of-air drills, controlled ascents)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In theory, failing to maintain buddy contact or bolting to the surface without control should be grounds
                to withhold certification. In practice, however:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Standards are minimums, not guarantees of ongoing proficiency</li>
                <li>Instructors can certify once skills are demonstrated, even if earlier performance was shaky</li>
                <li>Commercial pressures may favor “getting the student through” over hard fails</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>2. Why That’s Not Enough</summary>
            <p>A certification card confirms that, at some point, the diver demonstrated minimum skills under
                supervision.
                It does <strong>not</strong> certify:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Long-term competence</li>
                <li>Judgment under stress</li>
                <li>Reliability as a buddy in real-world conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This gap means unsafe behaviors can slip past the certification process. Agencies set the baseline;
                instructors enforce it. After that, it’s up to the diver.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>3. How to Protect Yourself with Buddy Vetting</summary>
            <p>If you’re paired with an unknown diver, treat the first dive as an evaluation, not just a dive. Before
                getting in the water:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask about recent diving experience, max depth, and comfort in similar conditions</li>
                <li>Review gas management rules (turn pressure, reserve limits)</li>
                <li>Agree on lost-buddy procedures and separation limits</li>
                <li>Confirm hand signals, especially for emergencies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>During the first dive together:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep the plan conservative</li>
                <li>Watch for signs of stress or poor situational awareness</li>
                <li>If unsafe behavior occurs, decline to buddy up for deeper or more complex dives</li>
            </ul>
        </details>

            <summary>4. Buddy-Vetting Checklist for Every Diver</summary>
            <div class="checklist">
                <h4>Questions to Ask:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When was your last dive?</li>
                    <li>What’s your deepest dive and in what conditions?</li>
                    <li>Are you comfortable practicing an air-sharing drill?</li>
                    <li>What’s your gas turn/reserve rule?</li>
                    <li>How do you handle low visibility or separation?</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Things to Watch:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comfort with gear</li>
                    <li>Consistent buddy checks</li>
                    <li>Attitude toward safety stops and ascent rates</li>
                    <li>Willingness to communicate and adapt</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </details>

        <p class="note"><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Agencies have some responsibility — they set standards and
            expect
            instructors to enforce them. Instructors bear the most direct responsibility for certifying only those who
            meet standards. But ultimately, we as divers must take ownership of our own safety by vetting buddies,
            diving conservatively with new partners, and walking away from unsafe pairings without guilt.</p>
