        <p>Dive computers are incredible tools. They have revolutionized recreational and technical diving, providing
            real-time feedback and precise decompression tracking. But here's something many divers don't fully
            appreciate: these computers are built around a <strong>theoretical "average diver."</strong> If you fall
            outside that average—whether you are in excellent shape or carrying extra weight—your real decompression risk
            may not match what your computer tells you.</p>

        <h2>The Theory: How Dive Computers Work</h2>
        <section>

            <p>Every dive computer is powered by a mathematical model that simulates how nitrogen (or other inert gases)
                dissolves into, and is released from, your body's tissues. These models divide the body into multiple
                <em>"compartments,"</em> each with a different <strong>half-time</strong>—the time it takes for a tissue
                to absorb or release half of its nitrogen load.
            </p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fast compartments:</strong> Blood, brain, and other highly perfused tissues (half-times of
                    5–10 minutes).</li>
                <li><strong>Medium compartments:</strong> Muscle, skin (half-times of 20–60 minutes).</li>
                <li><strong>Slow compartments:</strong> Fat and connective tissue (half-times of 120+ minutes).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The dive computer calculates tissue pressures based on these models, assuming a diver with
                <strong>average health, fitness, and body composition</strong>—typically someone lean and active.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Two Divers, One Dive Profile</h2>

        <section>
            <p>Let’s consider two hypothetical divers, both on a multi-day trip:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diver A:</strong> Lean, fit, exercises regularly, low body fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Diver B:</strong> Sedentary lifestyle, carries significant belly fat, but otherwise healthy.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Both divers complete 5 dives per day over 2 days, each dive at 80–90 feet for ~50 minutes on EAN32, with
                standard surface intervals (1–2 hours). Their dive computers show identical no-decompression limits,
                ascent rates, and "OK to fly" times.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>Why the Risk Isn’t Equal</h2>

        <section>
            <p>Even though their computers read the same, their bodies handle nitrogen very differently:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diver A:</strong> Lean tissues absorb and release nitrogen efficiently. His body closely
                    matches the computer’s model.</li>
                <li><strong>Diver B:</strong> Fat tissues absorb nitrogen slowly but <em>retain it much longer.</em>
                    Over multiple dives, his fat becomes a deep nitrogen reservoir that can fuel bubble formation even
                    after a safe ascent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This difference is invisible to the dive computer, which continues to model both divers the same
                way—assuming nitrogen is being absorbed and released at standard rates. The result? Diver B may carry a
                <strong>significantly higher risk of decompression sickness (DCS)</strong> even when following every
                rule.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Why Fitness Matters—But Doesn’t Make You Invincible</h2>

        <section>
            <p>It’s tempting to think that being fit and lean gives you a "get out of jail free" card. But that’s a
                dangerous misconception. Fit divers may have:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Better perfusion and gas exchange,</li>
                <li>Faster nitrogen clearance,</li>
                <li>Better cardiovascular resilience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, <strong>fitness doesn’t change the gas laws.</strong> A rapid ascent, missed stop, or pushing
                no-decompression limits can still result in DCS, no matter how healthy you are.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>The Dive Computer’s Blind Spot</h2>
        <section>

            <p>Your dive computer cannot know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your body composition (lean vs. high fat),</li>
                <li>Your fitness or circulation efficiency,</li>
                <li>Your hydration status or other health factors (e.g., smoking).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Unless you manually adjust its conservatism settings, your computer models you as the theoretical average
                diver—potentially underestimating your real risk if you diverge from that norm.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
        <section>

            <p>To keep your risk in check, here are some practical steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay in shape:</strong> Regular exercise and maintaining a healthy body weight keeps you
                    closer to the "average diver" the models assume.</li>
                <li><strong>Use conservative settings:</strong> If your computer allows, adjust gradient factors or
                    conservatism levels to add a safety buffer.</li>
                <li><strong>Extend surface intervals:</strong> Allow more time between dives, especially after deep or
                    repetitive dives.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrate well:</strong> Good circulation supports better nitrogen off-gassing.</li>
                <li><strong>Know your limits:</strong> Even fit divers should avoid pushing dive profiles to the edge.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <h2>A Balanced Message</h2>
        <section>

            <p>This isn't about shaming anyone for body composition. Many of us have extra weight, and diving remains an
                enjoyable and safe activity with proper precautions.

            <p>The goal is awareness: understanding that <strong>dive computers aren’t magic—they’re tools based on averages.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Staying fit keeps you aligned with those averages, but everyone benefits from conservative, thoughtful dive planning.
            </p>

            <p>Whether you're a lean diver or carrying a bit of extra weight, respect the gas laws, dive conservatively,
                and remember: when it comes to decompression risk, it’s what’s beneath the surface—of both the water and
                your physiology—that counts.</p>
