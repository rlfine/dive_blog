    <p>For divers, the concept of <strong>Work of Breathing (WOB)</strong> is not theoretical — it is real, measurable,
      and potentially life-affecting, especially as you dive deeper or perform multiple dives in a day.</p>


    <h2>What is Work of Breathing?</h2>
    <section>
      <p>Work of Breathing refers to the physical effort required to inhale and exhale against the resistance of the
        breathing system. Underwater, factors like gas density, regulator design, and your body's own airway resistance
        all contribute to this effort.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>When Does WOB Become Noticeable?</h2>
    <section>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shallow Dives (&lt;100 ft / 30 m):</strong> Most divers do not notice WOB unless heavily exerting
          themselves.</li>
        <li><strong>Deeper Dives (&gt;130 ft / 40 m):</strong> Breathing starts to feel "thicker," heavier, and slower,
          even at a normal swimming pace.</li>
        <li><strong>Very Deep Dives (&gt;200 ft / 60 m):</strong> Without helium mixes, WOB can become the limiting
          factor long before oxygen or nitrogen toxicity risks.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Factors Affecting Work of Breathing</h2>
    <section>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gas Density:</strong> Air becomes 4x denser at 30 meters, making breathing harder.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulator Performance:</strong> Poorly tuned second stages drastically increase WOB.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Fitness and Age:</strong> Older divers may notice WOB effects earlier due to reduced lung
          elasticity and respiratory muscle strength.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Consequences of High Work of Breathing</h2>
    <section>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Respiratory muscles tire more quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>CO<sub>2</sub> Retention:</strong> Poor gas exchange leads to increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels,
          causing headaches, confusion, anxiety, and air hunger.</li>
        <li><strong>Panic Response:</strong> A dangerous cycle of rapid breathing and perceived air starvation can
          develop if unaddressed.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Managing Work of Breathing</h2>
    <section>
      <p>To minimize WOB, divers should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use high-quality, deep-rated regulators.</li>
        <li>Breathe slowly and deeply to reduce resistance.</li>
        <li>Use helium-containing mixes (Trimix) for dives beyond recreational limits.</li>
        <li>Ensure all equipment is properly tuned and serviced.</li>
      </ul>
