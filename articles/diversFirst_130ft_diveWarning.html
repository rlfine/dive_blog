      <h2>If You’re Planning Your First Dive to 130 Feet—And You’re Not At Least a Little Bit Worried—You’re Not Ready
      </h2>

      <p>
        That might sound harsh, but it’s not a criticism of your curiosity or courage. It’s a reflection of how serious
        deep diving really is—and how often divers mistake supervision for safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve met many dive professionals, a few fall into the <em>excellent</em> category, and I trust a small subset
        with my life. But no dive pro, no matter how skilled, can substitute for <strong>your own
          readiness</strong>—mentally, physically, and emotionally. </p>

      <p>Depth doesn’t just test your training; it tests your
        judgment, your equipment, your breathing discipline, and your ability to stay calm when things start to go
        sideways.
      </p>

      <p>
        A little healthy fear at 130 feet is a sign that your survival instinct is working. It means you’re thinking
        about your narcosis threshold, your gas supply, your suit compression, and your ability to manage yourself if
        things change quickly.
      </p>


      <h3>1. Narcosis Is Not a Maybe—It’s a Certainty</h3>
      <p>
        At 130 feet, narcosis isn’t something you <em>might</em> feel. It’s something you <em>will</em> feel. The
        effects range from mild tunnel vision to full-blown mental fog, confusion, or inappropriate confidence. </p>

      <p>
        If you don’t recognize it—it’s already affecting you.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Your Buddy Isn’t Your Backup—They’re Narced Too</h3>
      <p>
        The buddy system assumes someone can help if things go wrong. But at 130 feet, both of you are affected by
        narcosis. If your buddy panics, misses a detail, or forgets a skill—they’re not your lifeline. You have to plan
        assuming you’ll need to manage yourself <em>and</em> help them if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>3. That 7mm Suit Isn’t 7mm Anymore</h3>

      <p>
        If you are diving in a deep lake, or anywhere the water is cold, thermal protection becomes key factor. Diving
        in cold water at 30 or 40 feet with a 5mm or even a 7mm wetsuit is a relatively easy skill to master.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neoprene compresses. What keeps you warm at 50 feet might become the thermal equivalent of a rash guard at 130.
        A cold diver is a distracted diver—and that distraction burns gas, clouds judgment, and speeds up fatigue. If
        you dive deep in a wetsuit, layer intelligently and expect thermal loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neoprene compression impacts buoyancy as well. You might need upwards of 30 pounds of lead to descend from the
        surface in a 7mm wetsuit. But Boyle's law works on the air cells in the neoprene wetsuit same as it does on the
        lift bag, the SMB, your lungs, and the gas you breathe. When the 7mm wetsuits compresses down to something less
        than a 3mm wetsuit at 130 feet, you will suddenly find yourself 20-30 pounds over weighted. If you have an
        equipment failure and need to jetison some weight, you might find yourself on a fast elevator to the surface -
        racing past any intended deep stop and especially racing past the mandatory safety stop.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Your Gas Is Thicker, and Your Time Is Shorter</h3>
      <p>
        At five atmospheres, every breath takes five times the surface gas volume—and the increased density makes each
        breath more effortful. That combination means you’ll consume gas faster and feel like you’re working harder just
        to breathe. Plan your gas with a margin, and practice your ascent with awareness.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Cold, Dark, and Rising CO₂: The Anxiety Spiral</h3>
      <p>
        Deep, dark water. Cold creeping into your core. A rising heart rate. You breathe faster. CO₂ builds. Anxiety
        rises. And unless you interrupt that feedback loop, it gets worse—not better. Recognizing this cycle before it
        starts is critical. Breath control and pre-dive mindfulness are your best defenses.
      </p>

      <p class="callout">
        Deep diving isn’t about pushing your limits. It’s about knowing them. If you're not at least a little bit
        concerned before your first 130-foot dive, then you’re not thinking clearly about what depth really demands.
        Respect the depth. Prepare for the dive. And never let ego take the lead.
