    <h1>Understanding Gas Laws in Diving: Beyond the Names</h1>

    <p>Scuba divers are introduced early on to a series of gas laws—Boyle's, Charles', Dalton's, Henry's, and
      Gay-Lussac's. While these names are tied to the scientists who described them, memorizing who said what isn't what
      keeps a diver safe.</p>
    <p>What matters most is knowing what these laws mean for your body, your gas mix, and your gear
      while underwater.</p>

    <div class="sidebar">
      <strong>Teaching Tip:</strong> While many courses emphasize matching gas laws to names, what truly helps divers is
      understanding the <strong>effect</strong> those laws have on their bodies and equipment. Learning that <em>partial
        pressure of nitrogen drives narcosis</em> or that <em>oxygen toxicity risk rises with depth</em> matters far
      more than recalling who discovered the principle.
    </div>

    <h2>Partial Pressure: The Core Concept</h2>
    <div class="law">
      <strong>What it means:</strong> In a gas mix, each gas exerts part of the total pressure. As depth increases, so
      does the pressure—and so does each gas’s partial pressure.
      <br>
      <strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the key to understanding oxygen toxicity and nitrogen narcosis.
    </div>

    <p>Take EAN36 (36% oxygen, 64% nitrogen). At 33 feet, the total pressure is 2 ATA. The partial pressure of oxygen is
      <code>0.36 × 2 = 0.72 ATA</code>. At 99 feet? It’s <code>0.36 × 4 = 1.44 ATA</code>—a dangerously high oxygen
      exposure. <strong>This isn't trivia—it’s your life support plan.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Nitrox Isn’t About More Oxygen—It’s About Less Nitrogen</h2>
    <p>Many divers fixate on oxygen as the benefit of Nitrox. But the real advantage is less nitrogen absorption. That’s
      Henry’s Law in action, though you don’t need to know his name to understand:</p>

    <div class="law">
      <strong>What it means:</strong> The higher the pressure, the more gas dissolves in your blood and tissues.
      <br>
      <strong>Why it matters:</strong> Less nitrogen in your mix = slower tissue saturation = longer bottom times and
      less decompression risk.
    </div>

    <h2>The Names Are Anchors, Not Goals</h2>
    <p>Boyle tells us that volume and pressure are inversely related—so air in your BCD or lungs shrinks as you descend.
      Charles and Gay-Lussac relate to how tanks behave with temperature. These names can be useful <em>reference
        points</em>, but they should never overshadow the goal: diving safely with a working understanding of how your
      gas behaves.</p>

    <div class="sidebar">
      <strong>Instructor Insight:</strong> Try framing gas laws as questions: "What happens to air in your BCD at
      depth?" or "Why is Nitrox safer at 80 feet than air?" Then tie it back to the principle—mention the name last, if
      at all.
    </div>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Knowing <em>what partial pressure is</em> matters more than knowing Dalton’s name.</li>
      <li>✅ Understanding <em>how nitrogen dissolves</em> matters more than crediting Henry.</li>
      <li>✅ Recognizing <em>gas expansion on ascent</em> is more vital than quoting Boyle.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>History gave us the tools. But your dive plan, your safety, and your decisions underwater depend on understanding
      the principles—not passing a trivia test.</p>

    <h1>And Now The Obligatory Pedantic Layering</h1>

    <button class="accordion">📘 Archimedes’ Principle</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>“A body immersed in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it
          displaces.”</strong></p>
      <p>This explains buoyancy — why things float or sink. In diving, it's the core principle behind buoyancy
        compensators and the need for proper weighting.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">📗 Boyle’s Law</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>“At constant temperature, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume.”</strong></p>
      <p><code>P₁V₁ = P₂V₂</code></p>
      <p>As pressure increases, volume decreases. This explains lung compression during descent and expansion during
        ascent.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">📕 Charles’ Law</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>“At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute
          temperature.”</strong></p>
      <p><code>V₁/T₁ = V₂/T₂</code></p>
      <p>As temperature rises, gas expands. This is why tank pressure increases in hot weather.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">📙 Gay-Lussac’s Law</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>“At constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute
          temperature.”</strong></p>
      <p><code>P₁/T₁ = P₂/T₂</code></p>
      <p>Explains why scuba tanks must not be left in the sun — pressure inside can rise dangerously.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">📒 Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>“The total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual
          gases.”</strong></p>
      <p><code>P_total = P₁ + P₂ + P₃ + ...</code></p>
      <p>This law is key in calculating oxygen exposure (ppO₂) when diving with Nitrox or Trimix.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">📓 Henry’s Law</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>“The amount of gas that dissolves in a liquid is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above
          the liquid.”</strong></p>
      <p><code>C = kP</code></p>
      <p>This is the basis of decompression theory — more pressure = more nitrogen dissolves into your tissues.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">❓ Does nitrogen in your tissues increase fivefold at 40 meters?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p><strong>Yes—if you stay long enough for tissue equilibrium.</strong></p>
      <p>At 40 meters (131 feet), pressure is 5 ATA. According to Henry’s Law, if you breathe air long enough for your
        tissues to saturate, there will be up to <em>five times</em> as much nitrogen as  would be at the surface. That's 5
        times more Nitrogen that entered body tisses as very small N<sub>2</sub> molecules.</p>
      <p><strong>Example: </strong>At 1 ATA, ~2.9 × 10<sup>17</sup> nitrogen molecules are dissolved per cubic
        centimeter of tissue. At 5
        ATA, this increases to ~1.45 × 10<sup>18</sup> per cc (if equilibrium is reached).</p>
      <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The more nitrogen your body absorbs, the more careful you must be during
        ascent. All of those extra molecules of Nitrogen have to come out, and that process starts as soon as the diver
        begins the ascent when  nitrogen tension exceeds ambient pressure. Rapid ascent risks forming bubbles
        faster than they can be off-gassed—leading to decompression sickness. </p>
      <p>Understanding the partial pressure of inert gasses (e.g., nitrogen) within a tissue is critical in determining
        the safe ascent rate and the need for a safety stop or even a decompression stop. </p>
      <p> Knowing that the gas law was developed in the 19th centrury be the English chemist William Henry can help one
        pass a certification exam or impress fellow divers, but knowning how partial pressures work can keep one safe
        underwater.
