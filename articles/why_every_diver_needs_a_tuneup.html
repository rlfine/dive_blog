  <h2>Diver, Tune Thyself: Why We Should All Welcome a Good Tune-Up</h2>
<section>
  <p><em>By a diver who’s finally getting comfortable — and still learning</em></p>

  <p>
    After a week of diving in Cozumel, I found myself reflecting on a quiet but unsettling trend in recreational scuba: 
	the belief, held by some, that the Open Water certification card is proof positive that you’re a diver. 
	Sure, it means you've passed some essential skills. 
	But in practice, I think many of us — myself included — reach a dangerous milestone: <em>that point where confidence outpaces competence.</em> 
  </p>

  <p>
	I’m only now, with a hundred or so dives under my belt, starting to feel genuinely comfortable underwater. 
	That comfort wasn’t automatic, and it certainly didn’t come from the card.
  </p>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #0077cc; padding-left: 1em; margin: 1em 0;">
    <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Comfort in the water does not automatically equal competence. 
	True skill comes from honest, ongoing self-assessment and correction.
  </div>

  <p>
    The real turning point came not from dive count, but from mindset. 
	Somewhere along the way, I realized that treating dive training as a one-and-done achievement is like treating high school gym class as sufficient preparation for a marathon. 
	Diving, especially if you want to stay safe, relaxed, and self-reliant, takes more than hours underwater. 
	It takes honest feedback — <strong> from good instructors </strong> — and a willingness to accept correction without letting ego get in the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’ve seen it and felt it myself: that twinge of awkwardness when an instructor gently suggests rerouting your SPG hose or fine-tuning your trim. 
	You think, "I’ve got a hundred dives — I should know this by now." But that mindset blocks growth. 
	Over time, I’ve come to value those small pieces of advice more than a pat on the back. 
	In fact, I’ve started to view training dives where the instructor has “no notes” as a missed opportunity. 
	If I walk away from a specialty or recertification dive without learning something new or being challenged on a habit, I probably need a better instructor — or a more open mindset.
  </p>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #0077cc; padding-left: 1em; margin: 1em 0;">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If an instructor tells you "everything looks great" without offering a single suggestion for improvement, you may not be getting the best value from your tune-up.
  </div>

  <p>
    That’s why I’ve made it a personal policy — and a family one with my grandkids — to take at least one instructor-led course each year. 
	It’s not about collecting cards. It’s about intentional recalibration. A way to catch creeping bad habits before they become second nature. 
	A chance to have a professional evaluate my setup, my buoyancy, my situational awareness. These tune-ups are less about new skills, and more about refining old ones.
  </p>

  <h3>Certifications Worth Repeating</h3>
  <p>
    While every diver benefits from a skills review, certain certifications stand out as being especially valuable to revisit periodically:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Deep Diver:</strong> Diving below 60 feet introduces additional risks, from narcosis to faster gas consumption. Skills like managing ascent rates, monitoring no-decompression limits, and handling buoyancy shifts at depth need regular reinforcement.</li>
    <li><strong>Navigation Diver:</strong> Good underwater navigation reduces stress, prevents buddy separation, and can be critical in low visibility. Repeating this course helps sharpen natural navigation techniques and compass precision that tend to fade without frequent use.</li>
    <li><strong>Rescue Diver:</strong> Perhaps the most important repeat. Rescue skills are highly perishable. Remember: it's one thing to pass a rescue course at your peak condition — it's another thing to react under real stress months or years later. A Rescue Diver card that’s three years old without refreshers may be more liability than asset in an emergency.</li>
  </ul>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #cc0000; padding-left: 1em; margin: 1em 0;">
    <strong>Caution:</strong> Don't assume a Rescue Diver card automatically makes you "rescue ready." Regular hands-on practice keeps critical reactions sharp when it matters most.
  </div>

  <p>
    Dive shops often ask, “How many dives have you done in the past year?” It’s a fair question, but it rests entirely on self-assessment. 
	There’s no quick and easy way to tell if a diver with 50 dives has been learning and improving — or just repeating the same mistakes 50 times. 
	That’s where formal, hands-on training comes in. It’s a way to have someone else look under the hood.
  </p>

  <p>
    And to be clear: this isn’t a post about newbie divers. 
	It’s about <strong>all of us</strong>. I don’t care if you’ve logged 25 dives or 250. 
	The ocean has a way of humbling you when you least expect it. 
	Training is the antidote to complacency. And accepting feedback with gratitude — not embarrassment — is what separates the merely certified from the truly capable.
  </p>

  <p>
    So if you’re reading this and haven’t trained with an instructor in a while, I encourage you to do it. 
	Not for the plastic card. Not to prove anything to anyone. But to stay sharp. 
	To improve. 
	And to be the kind of buddy who’s not just present underwater, but reliable in a pinch.
  </p>

  <div style="border-left: 4px solid #0077cc; padding-left: 1em; margin: 1em 0;">
    <strong>Closing Thought:</strong> Few of us dive perfectly. But we can all dive better — if we choose to stay humble, curious, and open to good instruction.
  </div>

  <p><em>Dive safe, dive smart — and don’t forget your tune-up.</em></p>
