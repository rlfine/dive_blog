            <p style="font-size: larger;">Night diving or any diving for that matter, when visibility challenges
                increase the risk of losing contact with your buddy, a buddy line is an option to consider.
                This post introduces the buddy line, and two practical search patterns divers can use during an agency
                Rescue Diver certification scenario—or any dive conducted in low-visibility conditions, including night
                diving or murky waters.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                The buddy line is not something you will typically use on a clear, high visibility Caribbean drift dive,
                but not all of us are so fortunate to be able to do all of our dives in such pristine conditions. And,
                maybe not all of us want to - there is a certain feeling of accomplishment that we might experience by
                diving the depths of a lake or quarry, looking at the abundant fresh water life there.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                Being prepared for the challenges of a low visibility dive will enhance the experience.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: larger;">
                When surface support is unavailable and visibility is below 5 feet, a <strong>buddy line</strong> can
                significantly improve safety and effectiveness during diver searches. Advanced dive certification and
                even the search and recovery speciality mention the buddy line, but I have yet to see an instructor pull
                one out and demonstrate the use and let student divers practice with it.
            </p>

            <h2>Buddy-Line Configuration</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Length: 6 to 7 feet</li>
                <li>Material: Bright-colored nylon line or 3/16" braided rope</li>
                <li>Knots/tape every 2 feet for tactile reference</li>
                <li><strong>Clipped-in</strong>: Use bolt snaps to D-rings for hands-free use</li>
                <li><strong>Hand-held</strong>: For rapid drop in entanglement-prone areas</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Expanding Square Search</h2>
            <p>Best used when the last known point is identified. One diver navigates using a compass and kick cycles
                while the buddy mirrors the pattern at a 6-foot distance, connected by the buddy line.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Start at center point (LKP)</li>
                <li>Swim legs in square, increasing each by ~5 ft</li>
                <li>Turn 90° at each corner, using compass headings</li>
                <li>Maintain slight line tension and communicate turns via tugs or hand signals</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>U-Pattern Sweep</h2>
            <p>Ideal when no precise starting point exists or in drift-prone environments. Divers swim horizontal lanes,
                covering ground systematically, then turn back in a U-shape.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold compass heading during each sweep pass</li>
                <li>Maintain lateral buddy spacing with line</li>
                <li>After each pass, shift laterally (e.g., 6 ft) and reverse direction</li>
                <li>Use tactile or visual signals to coordinate turns</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pre-Dive Briefing Card</h2>
            <div class="card">
                <strong>Objective:</strong> Conduct low-visibility diver search using buddy line<br>
                <strong>Team Roles:</strong> Navigator (compass/kick count) & Buddy (line contact/visual assist)<br>
                <strong>Pattern:</strong> Expanding Square or U-pattern (choose based on area)<br>
                <strong>Line Method:</strong> Clipped or Hand-held (based on environment)<br>
                <strong>Signals:</strong><br>
                - 1 tug = stop<br>
                - 2 tugs = turn<br>
                - 3 tugs = ascend/emergency<br>
                <strong>Abort If:</strong> Visibility lost, entanglement, or line slack/over-extension
            </div>

            <p>Practicing these patterns improves team coordination and effectiveness in stressful rescue or real-world
                scenarios.</p>
