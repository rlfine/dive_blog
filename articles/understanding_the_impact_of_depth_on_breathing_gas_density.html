<h1>Understanding the Impact of Depth on Breathing Gas Density</h1>
</header>

<article>

<p>When scuba diving, one of the most important but often overlooked aspects is how increasing depth affects the density of your breathing gas. This has major implications for both your gas consumption and your comfort underwater.</p>

<h2>How Pressure Affects Gas Density</h2>
<section>
<p>As you descend underwater, pressure increases by roughly <strong>1 atmosphere (atm)</strong> every <strong>10 meters (33 feet)</strong> of seawater. According to Boyle’s Law, while the volume of gas decreases under pressure, the number of gas molecules per given volume — the <strong>gas density</strong> — increases proportionally to ambient pressure.</p>

<p>At 30 meters depth (4 atm total pressure), the air you breathe is <strong>four times denser</strong> than at the surface. Every breath moves more mass through your airways, even though your tidal volume (the amount of gas per breath) stays roughly the same.</p>
</section>

<h2>Impact on Gas Consumption</h2>
<section>
<p>Because each breath contains more molecules at depth, your gas consumption rate increases linearly with ambient pressure. For example, if your surface air consumption (SAC) rate is 20 liters per minute, it will rise to 80 liters per minute at 30 meters depth. This is why divers must monitor gas reserves more carefully as they dive deeper.</p>
</section>

<h2>Impact on Work of Breathing (WOB)</h2>
<section>
<p>Increased gas density also raises the resistance to airflow through your regulator, mouth, throat, and lungs. This phenomenon is known as <strong>increased Work of Breathing (WOB)</strong>. Even with high-performance regulators, denser gases make it harder to inhale and exhale, leading to potential diver fatigue, CO<sub>2</sub> buildup, and breathing discomfort at depth.</p>
</section>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<section>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas Density:</strong> Increases proportionally with pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Gas Consumption:</strong> Increases linearly with depth.</li>
<li><strong>Work of Breathing:</strong> Becomes progressively harder the deeper you go.</li>
</ul>
