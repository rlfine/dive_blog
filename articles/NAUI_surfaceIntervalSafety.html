    <h2>Surface Intervals Less Than 10 Minutes in NAUI Air Dive Tables</h2>
    <p>Recreational dive tables, including those published by NAUI, do not credit surface intervals of less than 10
      minutes when performing repetitive dive calculations. But why? And how does this relate to other important safety
      concepts like safety stops, tissue compartment behavior, and the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) over
      multiple dives?</p>
    <p>This article walks through the detailed reasoning behind short surface intervals, the purpose of safety stops,
      and the differences between fast and slow tissue compartments in decompression theory.
    </p>
    <p>Whether you're a dive instructor or an aspiring Master Scuba Diver, this <em>deep dive</em> will help you
      anticipate the tough questions your students might ask — and help you answer them with confidence.</p>

    <h3>Why Surface Intervals < 10 Minutes Don’t Count</h3>

        <p>In NAUI Air Dive Tables, a surface interval of less than 10 minutes is not credited because it is not long
          enough to permit significant nitrogen off-gassing, especially from the slower tissue compartments. In fact, if
          we look cloely at the NAUI AIR DIVE TABLE, we see the mapping from the surface interval to the dive letter
          group for the next dive has no entries for less than 10 minutes. For example, Group G has 7 entries ranging
          from 24:00-5:42 all the way down to 0:50-0:10. What letter group do we use for the next dive after a 5 minute
          surface interval following a 35 minute dive to 60 feet? Here's the rule, and a bit leter we will develop the
          theory:
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          If diver surfaces and descends again within the window 0 to 10 minute, the two dives are treated as one
          continuous multilevel
          exposure. This is a conservative assumption that prevents underestimating residual nitrogen.
        <ul>
          <li>Rule: If SI &lt; 10 minutes → treat as a single dive</li>
          <li>Combine total bottom time</li>
          <li>Use the deepest depth reached</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          That sounds a whole lot like the NAUI dive tables are <em>discounting</em> the efficacy of a 10 minute surface
          interval. If that is the case, then we are open to asking the next really important question - If the 10
          minute SI is not counted, then why is there such a focus on the 3 minute safety stop at 12 feet? Can we
          discount that as well? Can we skip it if it doesn't count? Likely after the astute diver reads this paragraph,
          few are thinking to themselves 'Wow, this guy is really on to something!' And if any are, I hope we can
          disuaude them from following such a foolish position.
        </p>

        <p>Let's look closer at the 3 minute safety stop, and the the short (less than 10 minuite) surface interval.

        </p>
        <h3>Why Safety Stops Are Still Valuable</h3>

        <p>A 3–5 minute safety stop at 5 meters (15 feet) is not a surface interval, nor is it credited in dive table
          planning. However, it significantly reduces decompression risk by allowing fast tissues to off-gas more
          gently, reducing microbubble formation.</p>
        <p>Fast tissues (5–10 min half-times) are more likely to create microbubbles upon ascent if not given time to
          stabilize. Safety stops serve as a buffer zone to control off-gassing gradients and reduce embolic risk.</p>

        <h3>Fast vs. Slow Tissues: Off-Gassing and Risk</h3>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th>Fast Tissues</th>
              <th>Slow Tissues</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Half-Time</td>
              <td>5–10 min</td>
              <td>60–120+ min</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Absorption</td>
              <td>Quick</td>
              <td>Slow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Off-Gassing</td>
              <td>Quick</td>
              <td>Very slow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Bubble Risk</td>
              <td>High if uncontrolled ascent</td>
              <td>Low unless multi-dive buildup</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Tolerable Tension</td>
              <td>Low</td>
              <td>High</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>Slow tissues tolerate more supersaturation because they absorb and release nitrogen gradually. Fast tissues,
          by contrast, have lower tolerance and drive ascent profile design.</p>

        <h3>After Surfacing: Who’s Still Off-Gassing?</h3>

        <p>Upon surfacing, fast tissues are actively off-gassing and continue to do so for several minutes. If the diver
          made a safe ascent, the risk of microbubble formation is low. Slow tissues, however, may still be at peak
          saturation, or even continue to on-gas from venous return flow.</p>
        <p>This slow off-gassing becomes critical during repetitive dives. Multiple dives over 3–6 hours can load slow
          compartments beyond safe levels, particularly if short surface intervals and cold water reduce off-gassing
          rates.</p>

        <h3>DCIEM and Bubble Theory</h3>

        <p>DCIEM, VPM, and other bubble-based models (as opposed to dissolved gas-only models like Bühlmann ZHL)
          explicitly consider post-dive venous gas emboli. These models highlight that even if fast compartments are
          “clean,” nitrogen can still be released from slow tissues into circulation and create latent decompression
          stress.</p>
        <p>Thus, repetitive dives that appear conservative can still accumulate risk via slow tissue nitrogen loading
          and reverse gradients.</p>

        <h3>Final Takeaway</h3>

        <p>Surface intervals less than 10 minutes are treated conservatively because they provide negligible relief to
          the body’s slow tissues. Safety stops, while not counted in repetitive dive planning, are highly effective in
          reducing microbubble formation in fast tissues. Both practices reflect different safety priorities grounded in
          physiological reality. A dive leader or instructor should understand these distinctions to answer student
          questions with clarity and scientific accuracy.</p>
