      <h2 style="font-size:32px; color: darkblue; text-align: center;"> A deep dive into pressure, density <br> and the origin of the unit “torr.”</h2>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>We often think of ourselves as enlightened and far more learned than our historical
          predecessors. But the brilliance of 17th-century thinkers like Evangelista Torricelli reminds us that great
          leaps in understanding were made long before modern instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below is a modern Q&A styled exchange between a curious student and a professorial oracle
          <sup style="font-size:small;">1, 2, 3</sup>.

        </p>
      </div>


      <div class="accordion-container">

        <button class="accordion">
          Does the diameter of the inverted tube in Torricelli’s experiment matter?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          No, it does not — at least not for the final result. The height of the mercury column (~760 mm at sea level)
          depends only on atmospheric pressure and the density of mercury. This is described by the equation: \( P =
          \rho g h \). As long as the tube is wide enough to avoid capillary effects, the diameter does not change the
          height required to balance atmospheric pressure.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          Is it correct to say that the “weight of the air” supports the mercury column?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Yes — but with nuance. Atmospheric pressure, which results from the weight of the air above us, is what
          holds
          up the mercury column. However, it's more accurate to say that the mercury column is supported by
          atmospheric
          <em>pressure</em>, not direct weight. The "weight of air" explains where pressure originates, but it’s the
          pressure that balances the column.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          Would the results have changed if the mercury dish were larger or smaller?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Surprisingly, no. The size of the dish does not affect the column height. While a larger dish does increase
          the total force exerted by atmospheric pressure (F = P × A), it is the pressure at the point where the
          mercury enters the tube that matters. As long as the dish is big enough to keep the tube base immersed and
          prevent air from entering, it works the same.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          Could the dish be just barely large enough to seal the tube without spilling mercury?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Yes. Torricelli would still observe the same column height if the dish were only just large enough to
          maintain a mercury seal at the tube opening. What matters is that there’s a continuous mercury path exposed to
          atmospheric pressure — not the overall size of the reservoir.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          What would happen if Torricelli had used a denser liquid, like Lead or Bismuth?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          The mercury column would be shorter. The equation \( h = \frac{P}{\rho g} \) shows that height is inversely
          related to fluid density. So, a denser liquid like Lead or Bismuth would require a shorter column to balance
          atmospheric pressure. A hypothetical liquid Nobelium would make the vacuum column even shorter — though
          Nobelium's instability makes that purely theoretical.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          What if he had used a less dense liquid, like water or liquid sodium?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Then the vacuum column would be much taller. For example, to match atmospheric pressure with water, you'd
          need
          a column over 10 meters (about 34 feet) tall. This is why mercury — being dense and relatively stable — was
          ideal. Using a less dense liquid simply stretches the required height.
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">
          What’s the take-away for divers and curious thinkers today?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
          Torricelli’s experiment was the first proof that air has weight and pressure. It led to the creation of the
          unit “torr” — 1 torr equals 1 mm Hg. Understanding pressure in terms of weight per unit area helps divers
          grasp how pressure affects gas volumes, nitrogen absorption, and ascent safety. It’s a timeless reminder:
          simple physical experiments still teach powerful lessons.
