        <h2>üß¨ <span class="icon"></span>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Every breath a diver takes at depth is governed not just by tank pressure, but by biology‚Äîon a microscopic
            scale. This post explores how the structure of blood vessels in the lungs versus tissues governs gas
            exchange, and how this understanding informs decompression models like B√ºhlmann and DCIEM. Dive science is
            explained through the lens of real physiology, with relevance to every diver's safety.</p>

        <h2>ü´Å <span class="icon"></span>1. Gas Exchange at the Alveolar-Capillary Interface</h2>
        <p>The lungs are exceptionally efficient at gas exchange due to the thin alveolar-capillary barrier (0.2‚Äì0.6
            microns) and vast surface area (~70‚Äì100 m¬≤). Oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide move rapidly across this
            barrier according to Fick‚Äôs Law. This setup ensures rapid equilibration between inhaled gas and blood.</p>

        <h2>üí™ <span class="icon"></span>2. Gas Exchange in Systemic Tissues</h2>
        <p>In contrast to lungs, tissues such as muscle, fat, and tendons have thicker diffusion distances and lower
            perfusion rates. Gas uptake and elimination depend on local blood flow and gas solubility. Fat, while less
            perfused, absorbs more nitrogen over time due to its high lipid content but off-gasses slowly.</p>

        <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è <span class="icon"></span>3. Bubble Formation and Tissue Supersaturation</h2>
        <p>Bubbles rarely form in the lungs because of fast off-gassing, but tissues with slower diffusion and lower
            perfusion (like fat and joints) become supersaturated during ascent. Rapid ascents can lead to microbubble
            formation in these tissues, contributing to decompression sickness. This is why slow ascents and safety
            stops are essential.</p>

        <h2>üß† <span class="icon"></span>4. B√ºhlmann vs. DCIEM ‚Äî Modeling the Risk</h2>
        <p>The B√ºhlmann model, used by most recreational training agencies and dive computers, assumes independent
            tissue compartments with no inter-tissue diffusion. The Canadian DCIEM model includes inter-tissue diffusion
            and variable perfusion, offering more physiological accuracy. While DCIEM may better model complex
            exposures, its benefits are minimal for typical recreational diving.</p>

        <h2>üõü <span class="icon"></span>5. Practical Conclusion for Recreational Divers</h2>
        <p>For most divers, the B√ºhlmann model ‚Äî especially when used with conservative gradient factors ‚Äî is more than
            adequate. Inter-tissue diffusion, while real, adds little in the context of short, non-saturation dives.
            Divers should focus on slow ascents, proper surface intervals, and dive planning with attention to residual
            nitrogen.</p>

        <h2>üîö <span class="icon"></span>Closing Thoughts</h2>
        <p>From the microstructure of your alveoli to the model inside your dive computer, decompression safety is
            rooted in biology. Understanding how your body handles inert gas can help you make smarter, safer decisions
            underwater and on the surface. Dive smart ‚Äî and give your tissues the time they need.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-top:50px;">üìö <span class="icon"></span>Optional Extras</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bonus:</strong> What is the slowest off-gassing tissue in the human body?
                <br><b>Answer:</b>
                <p style="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left: 30px;">Fat (adipose tissue) is the slowest off-gassing tissue due to its low perfusion and
                high nitrogen solubility. Although it absorbs nitrogen slowly, it holds a large volume and takes a long
                time to release it. This makes fat a major consideration during repetitive or multi-day dives, where
                residual nitrogen can accumulate and increase decompression risk if ascent profiles aren‚Äôt conservative.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top:10px;margin-left: 30px;">
                    While even more poorly perfused, the next slowest off-gassing tissue after fat is typically
                    cartilage, followed closely by tendons and ligaments. However, unlike fat, tendons and ligaments
                    have low nitrogen solubility due to their low lipid content. That means they don‚Äôt absorb a lot of
                    nitrogen, but what they do absorb takes a long time to release due to minimal blood flow.
                </p>
