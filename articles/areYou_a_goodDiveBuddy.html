    <h1>Are You a Good Dive Buddy?</h1>
    <h2>Taking the Responsibility of Being a Dive Buddy Seriously</h2>

    <blockquote>
      “Plan your dive. Dive your plan.”<br>
      But don’t forget: <strong>You are part of someone else’s plan.</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Too often on dive boats, especially in popular destinations, divers are paired with little more than a name
      exchange and a glance at each other’s gear. One diver might be a photographer eager to chase the perfect shot
      inside a coral head. The other might be on their first drift dive, nervously trying to keep up. Both may assume
      the other knows what they’re doing. Neither has a shared understanding of the plan—or of each other.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result? Dive buddies that surface 30 meters apart, unaware of each other's status, incapable of providing immediate
      aid if something goes wrong underwater. That’s not just poor form—it’s dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being a dive buddy isn't a checkbox on the dive roster—it's an <strong>active role</strong> that can make the
      difference between a smooth dive and a serious emergency. Good buddy diving requires preparation, communication,
      awareness, and mutual support.
    </p>

    <p>This post is about what it means to be a <strong>responsible dive buddy</strong>, and how to take that role
      seriously every time you enter the water.</p>

    <details open>
      <summary>1. Pre-Dive: The Conversation You <em>Must</em> Have</summary>
      <p>Before the “giant stride,” take a moment for <strong>real communication</strong>, especially with a newly
        assigned buddy. The pre-dive chat should cover:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gear Familiarity:</strong> Do you know how to release your buddy’s weights? Are their releases
          buckles, Velcro, or pull handles? Is their alternate air source integrated into the BCD or a standard octopus?
        </li>
        <li><strong>Dive Objectives:</strong> Are you both here to explore or is one taking photos or doing a skills
          dive? Any personal limits (depth, air, deco)?</li>
        <li><strong>Experience Levels:</strong> Who has more drift dive experience? Night dive? Wreck penetration? Any
          past incidents or medical issues the other should be aware of?</li>
        <li><strong>Emergency Expectations:</strong> At what air pressure will you turn the dive? What’s the maximum
          agreed-upon separation distance? Do you both carry a signaling device (DSMB, whistle, light)?</li>
        <li><strong>Final Check:</strong> Use your training agency’s checklist like BWRAF or SEABAG. It’s not just for
          students.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. During the Dive: Active Awareness</summary>
      <p>This is where buddy responsibility becomes most visible—and most often neglected.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Maintain Visual or Physical Contact:</strong> In low viz or drift currents, physical contact may be
          necessary. In clear water, visual contact must be frequent—<em>not occasional</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Situational Awareness:</strong> Regular air checks: “I’m at 1900. You?” Constant orientation:
          "We’ve drifted 50m from the reef wall." Depth matching: Avoid vertical separation—it kills visibility and
          awareness.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Adjusting for Each Other</summary>
      <div style="border-left: 5px solid #0077a8; padding-left: 12px; padding-right:12px;">

        <p>
          If one diver gets fascinated by a spotted eel, the other doesn’t wander off. If one wants to hang back to
          examine coral, the buddy stays close. If you’re bored—<strong>too bad</strong>. Your job is to be present.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Positioning matters.</strong> If you’re 1 meter behind and 1 meter above your buddy, you might have
          excellent visibility and awareness of them—but <strong>you’re in their blind spot.</strong><br>
          To <em>you</em>, everything’s fine.<br>
          To <em>them</em>, <strong>you’re gone</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make it a habit to stay <strong>within your buddy’s field of view</strong>, not just in range of your own.
        </p>

    <details>
      <summary>4. After the Dive: Debrief Together</summary>
      <p>
        Being a good buddy continues <strong>after the dive.</strong> Discuss:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Was anything unclear or unexpected?</li>
        <li>Did you lose visual contact? Why?</li>
        <li>Did either of you feel unsafe or unsure at any point?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Use this to <strong>improve your next dive</strong> together—or to respectfully speak up if the pairing needs
        to change.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Final Thoughts: The Buddy You’d Want</summary>
      <p>
        Being a good dive buddy isn’t just about checking boxes—it’s about being <strong>reliable</strong>,
        <strong>predictable</strong>, and <strong>aware</strong>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        If something went wrong on your dive…<br>
        <strong>Would you want <em>you</em> as your buddy?</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Take your responsibility seriously. Dive safe. And be the kind of diver others trust without question.
