    <blockquote>“You could be the 1%. And for you, it’s 100% DCS.”</blockquote>

    <p>When you read a dive table or glance at your dive computer’s no-decompression limits (NDLs), it’s tempting to
      believe you’re in the clear. Stay within the limits, ascend slowly, do your safety stop — and you'll be fine.
      Right?</p>

    <p>Well, maybe. But maybe not.</p>

    <h2>The Dive Tables Are Not a Safety Net — They’re a Statistical Model</h2>

    <p>Most decompression models — whether in the form of old-school tables or modern dive computers — are built on
      <strong>probabilistic models</strong>, not personal guarantees. That’s a crucial distinction.
    </p>

    <p>The U.S. Navy’s <em>Maximum Likelihood Statistical Method (MLSM)</em>, for instance, is a binomial distribution statistical model. It’s
      not based on precise knowledge of individual human physiology, but on thousands of dives analyzed for a yes/no
      outcome: <em>Did the diver get bent or not?</em> </p>
      <p>The NAUI RGBM Dive Tables are based on similar statistical models.</p>

    <p>Over time, the data is adjusted so that the table minimizes the number of DCS hits across the whole population of
      test dives.</p>

    <p>So what does that mean for you?</p>

<p>
  <blockquote>Dive tables and the algorithms in dive computers do not predict what will happen on your dive. 
  No, they predict what statistically happened on thousands of dives previously, dive performed by divers that we know little about.
</blockquote>
</p>

    <h2>Diving Safe Doesn't Mean Diving Risk-Free</h2>

    <p>If you follow the tables exactly — and match the <em>average diver</em> they were built around — your risk of
      decompression sickness (DCS) is likely very low. But:</p>

    <blockquote>You might not be that average diver.</blockquote>

    <p>Let’s say 1 in 100 divers will experience some level of DCS on a particular profile. By statistical standards, that means the dive is considered "safe" by
      most standards. But if <strong>you unknowingly resemble that one diver more than the other 99</strong>, your
      actual risk might be far higher.</p>

    <p>You might be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Older or less fit</li>
      <li>Dehydrated or inflamed</li>
      <li>Genetically predisposed to poor circulation or clotting</li>
      <li>Recovering from a minor illness or taking medication that affects your physiology</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And these factors don’t show up in the dive table. <strong> The model doesn't know you.</strong></p>

    <h2>Like a Lottery Ticket — But in Reverse</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> A lot of people (really, a lot, like in the 10's of millions) purchase a lottery ticked every week, and all
        are hoping they are in that 1% that actually win something.
      </li>
      <li> Thousands of people gear up every year and jump in the water for a 2-tank dive, and hope they are not in the
        1%
        that experience some level of DCS.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Buying a lottery ticket, you <em>hope</em> to be the 1%. When diving, you <strong>hope not</strong> to be the 1%.
      But the odds are calculated the same way — statistically.</p>

    <p>And the consequence?</p>

    <blockquote>For that unlucky 1%, the probability is irrelevant. The injury is real.</blockquote>

    <p>This isn't meant to scare you — it's meant to <em>inform</em> you. Recreational diving is generally very safe
      when approached conservatively. But thinking of the tables as "permission slips" instead of "risk calculators" is
      a dangerous mindset.</p>

    <h2>Most Divers Don’t Think They’re the 1% — Until They Are</h2>

    <p>Imagine this scenario:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You’re on a once-a-year cruise to Cozumel.</li>
      <li>You sign up for two morning dives.</li>
      <li>You feel healthy, maybe a little tired or underhydrated from the travel.</li>
      <li>Your first dive was 45 minutes, reaching a max depth of 30 meters. Right within the NDL.</li>
      <li>After a 90 minute SI, your second dive was a bit longer, but a bit shallower.  Still well within the NDL.</li>
      <li>That afternoon you feel a strange ache in your shoulder or back.</li>
      <li>You ignore it — maybe you slept funny.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By evening, you're in a recompression chamber.</p>

    <h2>So What Can You Do?</h2>

    <p>You can’t know your exact physiological risk, but you <strong>can tilt the odds in your favor</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Add margin:</strong> Stay well within limits, not on the edge.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydrate and rest:</strong> Before, during, and after your dive.</li>
      <li><strong>Be conservative with ascent rates and stops:</strong> Add a few minutes at 15–20 feet.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Nitrox wisely:</strong> For added NDL, not deeper dives.</li>
      <li><strong>Take care of your health:</strong> Fitness, sleep, and diet all matter.</li>
      <li><strong>Know your history:</strong> Talk to your doctor about things like PFO, clotting issues, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thought: Dive Tables Are a Map — Not a Promise</h2>

    <p>Dive tables and computers are incredible tools. But like any tool, they’re only as safe as the hands that use
      them.</p>

    <blockquote>You wouldn’t drive 100 mph just because your GPS says you’ll still arrive on time.<br>
      Don’t dive the edge just because your table says you’re "within limits."</blockquote>

    <p><strong>DCS doesn’t care that your computer said you were OK.</strong></p>

    <p>Dive smart. Dive conservative. Dive often — but never forget:</p>

    <blockquote>“You could be the 1%. And for you, it’s 100% DCS.”</blockquote>

    <h2>A Note About Dive Computers: They Don’t Know You</h2>

    <p>It’s easy to trust your dive computer. It feels intelligent, calculating your no-decompression limits, tracking
      ascent rates, logging your dives. But don’t let the glowing numbers fool you.</p>

    <blockquote>Your dive computer is not a real-time physiological monitor.</blockquote>

    <p>It has <strong>no sensors</strong> for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blood flow</li>
      <li>Gas loading in tissues</li>
      <li>Microbubble formation</li>
      <li>Inflammation, fatigue, hydration</li>
      <li>Age, weight, medications, fitness, or genetics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It doesn’t know what you ate, how you slept, or whether your right shoulder aches because of a slow bubble
      forming in your joint capsule.</p>

    <p><strong>What does it know?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>Time and depth. That’s it.</blockquote>

    <p>It does not know <em>you</em>. It knows <em>someone else</em> — the <strong>statistical average diver</strong> on
      which its decompression model was based.</p>

    <p>You may think it’s working for you — but in truth, it’s working for a hypothetical composite diver with average
      physiology and average risk tolerance. If you happen to deviate from that average in ways the computer can’t
      sense: your $500 dive computer's “OK” might not be OK for <em>you</em>.</p>

    <p>So yes, use your dive computer. Trust it — but not blindly.</p>

    <blockquote>Let it inform your decisions, not dictate them. And always add your own wisdom on top.</blockquote>
