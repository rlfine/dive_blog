        <div class="section-title" style="font-size: 2em;">Applying Engineering Reliability Principles to Dive Safety
        </div>

        <p>In the world of scuba diving, we often talk about redundancy and equipment checks—but how often do we step
            back and treat our dive rig like a critical life-support system? Drawing from reliability engineering
            principles used in industrial systems, we can gain powerful insights into how the components of our dive
            gear interact, and what our true system-level risk looks like.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Mean Time to Failure (MTTF): A Misunderstood Metric</div>
        <p>MTTF is a statistical average. When a regulator is rated for 100 hours MTTF, that doesn't mean it will fail
            at hour 100. It means that <em>on average</em>—over many units and conditions—a failure occurs every 100
            hours of use. Some fail early, some much later. This makes every dive a roll of the probabilistic dice.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Your Dive Rig as a Series System</div>
        <p>Let's define a typical single-tank recreational setup with no redundant first stage. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tank valve</li>
            <li>First stage regulator</li>
            <li>Primary second stage</li>
            <li>Octopus (cold standby)</li>
            <li>LP inflator</li>
            <li>Pressure gauge (SPG)</li>
            <li>4 hoses (2 LP, 1 HP, 1 spare)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In engineering, this is a <strong>series system</strong>: if any one component fails, the system fails.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Reliability Analysis</div>
        <p>We converted each component's MTTF into a failure rate (λ), then summed them to get the system-level failure
            rate.</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Tank valve: λ = 0.0001<br>
            First stage: λ = 0.002<br>
            Primary second stage: λ = 0.01<br>
            Octopus (10% on-demand failure): λ = 0.001<br>
            LP inflator: λ = 0.0033<br>
            SPG: λ = 0.001<br>
            Hoses (total): λ = 0.00267<br>
            ------------------------------<br>
            Total system λ = 0.02007 → MTTF ≈ 49.8 hours
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            Your dive system, under realistic assumptions, has a statistical mean time to failure of just under
            <strong>50 hours</strong>.
        </div>

        <div class="section-title">What If Your Octopus Is Neglected?</div>
        <p>If your backup second stage (octopus) is poorly maintained and has a 50% chance of working on demand:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Octopus λ = 0.01 × 0.5 = 0.005<br>
            New total λ = 0.02407 → MTTF ≈ 41.5 hours
        </div>
        <p>That's nearly a <strong>20% drop in system reliability</strong>, just from a backup reg being neglected.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Cold Standby ≠ Reliable</div>
        <p>An unused component, like the octopus, can suffer from dry O-rings, internal corrosion, or salt
            deposits—making it unreliable unless <strong>actively tested and maintained</strong>. You can't depend on it
            in an emergency unless it's cared for like your primary.</p>

        <div class="section-title">Recommendations for Divers</div>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;">Test your octopus on every dive (purge and check for bubbles).</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;">Service all second stages at the same interval—whether used or not.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;">Track gear usage hours, and consider MTTF when planning service intervals.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">The Bigger Picture: System Thinking</div>
        <p>Treat your dive rig like an engineered system:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;">Understand where redundancy exists—and where it doesn’t.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;">Model reliability, not just functionality.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;">Plan maintenance and testing intervals with failure rates in mind.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            Redundancy isn't safety unless it's maintained, tested, and trusted.
        </div>


        <div class="sidebar">Sidebar: MTTF and the Risks of Rental Gear</div>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Rental scuba gear</strong> at resorts often sees 3–4 dives per day, especially in saltwater
            conditions. While convenient, this equipment is under far more stress than gear owned and carefully
            maintained by occasional recreational divers.
        </div>
        <p>Key concerns with high-use rental gear:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;"><strong>Salt buildup:</strong> Saltwater dries inside BCD inflators, and over time, if not throughly
                rinsed, the buildup will cause sticking or free-flowing
                valves.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;"><strong>High wear rate:</strong> Regulators, second stages, and inflators reach their MTTF thresholds
                faster due to continuous cycles of wet/dry, pressure exposure, and handling. Second stage regulators are
                typically the <strong><em>ball at the end of the rope</em></strong>, banging and knocking on everything</li>
            <li><strong>Delayed maintenance:</strong> Depending on the dive shop, some operators may, from time to time, delay servicing to save costs, especially for
                backup gear. Delays in service intervals are among the biggest factor in debris accumulation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're renting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;"><strong>Test the inflator valve thoroughly</strong>—inflate/deflate multiple times before water entry.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;"><strong>Check all hoses and connections</strong> for leaks or cracks.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: .3em;"><strong>Breath through both second stages</strong> (primary and octopus), purging both.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirm SPG reads correctly</strong> and that the tank is fully pressurized before descent.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <div class="highlight" style="margin-top:2.5em;margin-bottom:2.5em;">
            You are not wrong to assume a <strong>greater responsibility</strong> when it comes to a thorough inspection of rental gear in your pre-dive routine—don't let the
                convenience of <strong><em>traveling light </em></strong>compromise your safety.
