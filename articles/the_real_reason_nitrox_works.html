<h2>Introduction</h2>
<section>
    <p>In recreational diving circles, it is not uncommon to hear divers praise enriched air (Nitrox) for how much "better" they feel after dives compared to using regular air. 
	While enriched air does offer real physiological benefits, the popular notion that it provides a "boost" due to additional oxygen is a persistent myth. 
	This article aims to clarify the true reasons Nitrox works and why the benefits are fundamentally tied to nitrogen management, not oxygen enhancement.
	</p>
</section>

<h2>1. Why Nitrox Exists</h2>
<section>
    <p>Nitrox, or enriched air, increases the fraction of oxygen (typically to 32% or 36%) while reducing the fraction of nitrogen compared to atmospheric air. 
	The primary objective of using Nitrox is to <strong>reduce nitrogen absorption</strong> during a dive. 
	By breathing a gas mixture with less nitrogen, divers can either extend bottom time within no-decompression limits or add a margin of safety against decompression sickness (DCS).
	</p>
</section>

<h2>2. Misunderstanding: The "Feeling Better" Myth</h2>
<section>
    <p>The human body is highly efficient at oxygen transport. At sea level breathing air (21% oxygen), arterial blood is already close to 97–100% saturated with oxygen under normal conditions. 
	Breathing a gas with slightly more oxygen at surface pressure does not significantly increase oxygen delivery to tissues. 
	Therefore, the perception of "feeling better" is not due to an actual physiological boost from the enriched oxygen but may stem from reduced nitrogen loading, placebo effect, or other factors such as better hydration or dive profile.
	</p>
</section>

<h2>3. Real Science: Oxygen Transport in the Human Body</h2>
<section>
    <p>Hemoglobin carries approximately 98% of the body's oxygen, with only a small fraction dissolved directly in plasma. 
	Even at elevated partial pressures underwater, the increase in plasma-dissolved oxygen is minimal relative to the body's overall oxygen needs. 
	Once on the surface, breathing Nitrox offers no practical enhancement in tissue oxygen delivery compared to regular air.
	</p>
</section>

<h2>4. Dangers of Extra Oxygen</h2>
<section>
    <p>Higher oxygen concentrations at depth come with significant risks. 
	Oxygen becomes toxic at elevated partial pressures, leading to the possibility of central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity. 
	Divers using Nitrox must strictly monitor their depth to stay within safe Maximum Operating Depths (MODs) to avoid seizures and other life-threatening symptoms of oxygen toxicity.
	</p>
</section>

<h2>5. Why We Use Oxygen (and Not Other Gases)</h2>
<section>
    <p>Oxygen is readily available, relatively inexpensive, and safe in controlled quantities. 
	Other gases that could hypothetically displace nitrogen—such as helium, neon, or hydrogen—pose additional challenges: cost, physiological hazards, or technical complexities. 
	Oxygen remains the practical and biologically compatible choice for creating a safer breathing gas.
	</p>
</section>

<h2>6. Philosophical Thought: "Reduced Nitrogen Diving"</h2>
<section>
    <p>In reality, Nitrox could more accurately be called "Reduced Nitrogen Diving." 
	The true benefit arises from decreasing nitrogen uptake, thereby reducing decompression stress. 
	The oxygen component, while vital to life, primarily serves as a convenient filler to push nitrogen levels lower within a safe and familiar physiological range.
	</p>
</section>

<h2>7. Misconception: Can Absorbed Oxygen Help Offset the Risks of Absorbed Nitrogen?</h2>
<section>
<p>It is tempting to assume that because oxygen is essential for life, any additional oxygen absorbed under pressure would be beneficial — especially when compared to the known risks associated with nitrogen absorption. 
However, this assumption is incorrect for several important reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Limited Oxygen Storage Capacity:</strong><br>
    Although breathing gases under pressure leads to greater dissolution of oxygen into plasma and tissues (per Henry’s Law), the body's ability to store usable oxygen is extremely limited. 
	Most oxygen is tightly bound to hemoglobin, and tissues do not act as large reservoirs for free oxygen that can be metabolized later. 
	The extra dissolved oxygen provides only seconds of additional supply in an emergency, not minutes.</li>

    <li><strong>High Oxygen is Not Always "Good":</strong><br>
    Excess oxygen under pressure can quickly become toxic, not therapeutic. 
	Elevated partial pressures of oxygen (>1.4 ATA PPO₂) can trigger central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity, leading to seizures, loss of consciousness, and death underwater.</li>

    <li><strong>No Protective Effect Against Nitrogen Stress:</strong><br>
    The nitrogen absorbed into body tissues under pressure is inert — it doesn't participate in metabolism but creates risk by forming bubbles during ascent if not managed carefully. Additional absorbed oxygen does not neutralize or counterbalance these inert nitrogen bubbles. 
	Oxygen and nitrogen behave independently in the body at depth.</li>

    <li><strong>Decompression Obligation Remains Unchanged by Extra Oxygen Alone:</strong><br>
    Decompression stress is determined primarily by nitrogen (or other inert gas) off-gassing rates, not by the presence of more oxygen. 
	Breathing higher oxygen fractions <em>can</em> accelerate off-gassing during decompression stops (hyperoxic deco), but only if properly planned — not passively by virtue of carrying extra tissue oxygen.</li>

    <li><strong>Reality at Depth:</strong><br>
    In an out-of-gas emergency at 100+ feet, even if tissues have a slight increase in dissolved oxygen, it will not sustain metabolism meaningfully. 
	Consciousness will still be lost within seconds without an active gas supply.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, more absorbed oxygen at depth <strong>does not provide a "safety cushion"</strong> against nitrogen absorption or decompression sickness. 
Proper dive planning, gas management, and adherence to no-decompression limits remain the only reliable methods to reduce risk.</p>
</section>

<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
<section>
    <p>Enriched air Nitrox is a powerful tool for extending dive times and improving dive safety. 
	However, its benefits are grounded in the reduction of nitrogen exposure, not an increase in oxygen performance. 
	Divers should embrace Nitrox for what it is: a safer gas blend through nitrogen management—not a magical oxygen tonic. 
	Understanding the science behind Nitrox will lead to better dive planning, safer profiles, and more informed divers.
